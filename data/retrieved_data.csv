Non-GAAP Financial Measures
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA
""EBITDA"" is defined as net loss before interest expense, income tax expense or benefit, and depreciation and amortization. ""Adjusted EBITDA"" is defined as EBITDA adjusted for stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, asset impairments, and other costs associated with exit and disposal activities, acquisition and related costs, changes to the fair value of contingent earnout shares liability, and any other one-time non-recurring transaction amounts impacting the statement of operations during the year. Adjusted EBITDA is intended as a supplemental measure of our performance that is neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. We believe Adjusted EBITDA, when combined with net loss, and EBITDA, is beneficial to an investor's complete understanding of our operating performance. We believe that the use of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial measures with those of comparable companies, which may present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. However, you should be aware that when evaluating EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA we may incur future expenses similar to those excluded when calculating these measures. In addition, our presentation of these measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Our computation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures computed by other companies, because all companies may not calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in the same fashion.
Because of these limitations, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. We manage our business utilizing EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as supplemental performance measures.

Forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of words such as ""estimate,"" ""plan,"" ""project,"" ""forecast,"" ""intend,"" ""will,"" ""expect,"" ""anticipate,"" ""believe,"" ""seek,"" ""target"" or other similar expressions that predict or indicate future events or trends or that are not statements of historical matters. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding estimates and forecasts of financial and performance metrics, projections of market opportunity and market share, expectations and timing related to commercial product launches and achievement of other operational milestones, including the ability to meet and/or accelerate anticipated production timelines, Canoo's ability to capitalize on commercial opportunities, anticipated customer orders, and expectations regarding development of facilities and the negotiation, availability or receipt of state incentives. These statements are based on various assumptions, whether or not identified in this press release, and on the current expectations of Canoo's management and are not predictions of actual performance. These forward-looking statements are provided for illustrative purposes only and are not intended to serve as, and must not be relied on by any investor as, a guarantee, an assurance, a prediction or a definitive statement of fact or probability. Actual events and circumstances are difficult or impossible to predict and will differ from assumptions. Many actual events and circumstances are beyond the control of Canoo. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including changes in domestic and foreign business, market, financial, political and legal conditions; failure to realize the anticipated benefits of the business combination with Hennessy Capital Acquisition Corp. IV; the rollout of Canoo's business and the timing of expected business milestones and commercial launch; future market adoption of Canoo's offerings; risks related to Canoo's go-to-market strategy and manufacturing strategy; the effects of competition on Canoo's future business; the ability to issue equity or equity-linked securities, and those factors discussed  under the captions ""Risk Factors"" and ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations"" in Canoo's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC"") on March 31, 2021, as well as its Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and other filings with the SEC, copies of which may be obtained by visiting Canoo's Investors Relations website at investors.canoo.com or the SEC's website at www.sec.gov. If any of these risks materialize or our assumptions prove incorrect, actual results could differ materially from the results implied by these forward-looking statements. There may be additional risks that Canoo does not presently know or that Canoo currently believes are immaterial that could also cause actual results to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements. In addition, forward-looking statements reflect Canoo's expectations, plans or forecasts of future events and views as of the date of this press release. Canoo anticipates that subsequent events and developments will cause Canoo's assessments to change. However, while Canoo may elect to update these forward-looking statements at some point in the future, Canoo specifically disclaims any obligation to do so. These forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as representing Canoo's assessments as of any date subsequent to the date of this press release. Accordingly, undue reliance should not be placed upon the forward-looking statements.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA
""EBITDA"" is defined as net loss before interest expense, income tax expense or benefit, and depreciation and amortization. ""Adjusted EBITDA"" is defined as EBITDA adjusted for stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, asset impairments, and other costs associated with exit and disposal activities, acquisition and related costs, changes to the fair value of contingent earnout shares liability, and any other one-time non-recurring transaction amounts impacting the statement of operations during the year. Adjusted EBITDA is intended as a supplemental measure of our performance that is neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. We believe Adjusted EBITDA, when combined with net loss, and EBITDA, is beneficial to an investor's complete understanding of our operating performance. We believe that the use of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial measures with those of comparable companies, which may present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. However, you should be aware that when evaluating EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA we may incur future expenses similar to those excluded when calculating these measures. In addition, our presentation of these measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Our computation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures computed by other companies, because all companies may not calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in the same fashion.
Because of these limitations, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. We manage our business utilizing EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as supplemental performance measures.

These statements are based on various assumptions, whether or not identified in this press release, and on the current expectations of Canoo's management and are not predictions of actual performance. These forward-looking statements are provided for illustrative purposes only and are not intended to serve as, and must not be relied on by any investor as, a guarantee, an assurance, a prediction or a definitive statement of fact or probability. Actual events and circumstances are difficult or impossible to predict and will differ from assumptions. Many actual events and circumstances are beyond the control of Canoo. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including changes in domestic and foreign business, market, financial, political and legal conditions; Canoo's ability to continue as a going concern; Canoo's ability to access existing and future sources of capital via debt or equity markets, which will impact execution of its business plans and could require Canoo to terminate or significantly curtail its operations; Canoo's history of losses; Canoo's ability to adequately control the costs associated with its operations; Canoo's ability to successfully build and tool its manufacturing facilities, establish or continue a relationship with a contract manufacturer or failure of operation of Canoo's facilities ; the rollout of Canoo's business and the timing of expected business milestones and commercial launch; future market adoption of Canoo's offerings; risks related to Canoo's go-to-market strategy and manufacturing strategy; the effects of competition on Canoo's future business, and those factors discussed  under the captions ""Risk Factors"" and ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations"" in Canoo's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC"") on March 30, 2023, as well as its past and future Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and other filings with the SEC, copies of which may be obtained by visiting Canoo's Investors Relations website at investors.canoo.com or the SEC's website at www.sec.gov.

In addition, forward-looking statements reflect Canoo's expectations, plans or forecasts of future events and views as of the date of this press release. Canoo anticipates that subsequent events and developments will cause Canoo's assessments to change. However, while Canoo may elect to update these forward-looking statements at some point in the future, Canoo specifically disclaims any obligation to do so.

""Globally there are approximately 1.5 billion light vehicles and we believe that 80% of those will be replaced by EVs over the next 4 to 5 car generations. Canoo's technology gives us a blank canvas to reimagine how the EV fits into our changing auto ecosystem.  We have focused on a use case approach to generate the largest possible total addressable market ('TAM') based off a common platform, our MPP1,"" said Tony Aquila, Canoo's Executive Chairman. ""We are building vehicles that are not burdened by legacy constraints and developing technologies and functional designs to build EVs for everyone. We believe we are the first OEM that is looking at the full lifecycle of the vehicle and building in multiple revenue touchpoints.""

Non-GAAP financial measures
This press release includes certain adjusted financial measures (namely, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA) that are non-GAAP financial measures (""NGFMs"") as defined under Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC"") rules.  Canoo believes these NGFMs provide useful information to investors as a supplement to its consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (""GAAP"").
The presentation of these NGFMs is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. These measures may be different from NGFMs used by other companies, because all companies may not calculate NGFMs in the same fashion. In addition, these NGFMs are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. NGFMs have limitations in that they do not reflect all the amounts associated with our results of operations as do the corresponding GAAP measures.
A reconciliation of the NGFMs measures included in this press release to the most comparable GAAP measure can be found in the tables included at the end of this press release.
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA
""EBITDA"" is defined as net loss before interest expense, income tax expense or benefit, and depreciation and amortization. ""Adjusted EBITDA"" is defined as EBITDA adjusted for share-based compensation, restructuring charges, asset impairments, and other costs associated with exit and disposal activities, acquisition and related costs, changes to the fair value of contingent earnout shares liability, and any other one-time non-recurring transaction amounts impacting the statement of operations during the year. Adjusted EBITDA is intended as a supplemental measure of performance that is neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. Canoo believes Adjusted EBITDA, when combined with net loss, and EBITDA, is beneficial to an investor's complete understanding of its operating performance.  Canoo believes that the use of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating its performance, ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial measures with those of comparable companies, which may present similar NGFMs to investors. However, you should be aware that when evaluating EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, Canoo may incur future expenses similar to those excluded when calculating these measures. In addition, Canoo's presentation of these measures should not be construed as an inference that its future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Canoo's computation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures computed by other companies, because all companies may not calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in the same fashion.
Because of these limitations, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Canoo compensates for these limitations by relying primarily on its GAAP results and using EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA on a supplemental basis. You should review the reconciliation of net loss to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA below and not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate Canoo's business.
Forward-Looking Statements
The information in this press release includes ""forward-looking statements"" within the meaning of the ""safe harbor"" provisions of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of words such as ""estimate,"" ""plan,"" ""project,"" ""forecast,"" ""intend,"" ""will,"" ""expect,"" ""anticipate,"" ""believe,"" ""seek,"" ""target"" or other similar expressions that predict or indicate future events or trends or that are not statements of historical matters. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding estimates and forecasts of financial and performance metrics, projections of market opportunity and market share, expectations and timing related to commercial product launches, potential success of, and ability to accelerate its, go-to-market strategy, and Canoo's ability to capitalize on commercial opportunities. These statements are based on various assumptions, whether or not identified in this press release, and on the current expectations of Canoo's management and are not predictions of actual performance. These forward-looking statements are provided for illustrative purposes only and are not intended to serve as, and must not be relied on by any investor as, a guarantee, an assurance, a prediction or a definitive statement of fact or probability. Actual events and circumstances are difficult or impossible to predict and will differ from assumptions. Many actual events and circumstances are beyond Canoo's control. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including changes in domestic and foreign business, market, financial, political and legal conditions; failure to realize the anticipated benefits of the business combination with Hennessy Capital Acquisition Corp. IV; the rollout of Canoo's business and the timing of expected business milestones and commercial launch; future market adoption of Canoo's offerings; risks related to Canoo's go-to-market strategy; the effects of competition on Canoo's future business; the ability to issue equity or equity-linked securities, and those factors discussed  under the captions ""Risk Factors"" and ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations""  in Canoo's registration statement on Form S-1 filed on January 13, 2021, and the definitive proxy statement/prospectus contained therein, and the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 to be filed with the SEC on or before March 31, 2021, as well as its other filings with the SEC, copies of which may be obtained by visiting Canoo's Investors Relations website at investors.canoo.com or the SEC's website at www.sec.gov. If any of these risks materialize or Canoo's assumptions prove incorrect, actual results could differ materially from the results implied by these forward-looking statements. There may be additional risks that Canoo does not presently know or that Canoo currently believes are immaterial that could also cause actual results to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements. In addition, forward-looking statements reflect Canoo's expectations, plans or forecasts of future events and views as of the date of this press release. Canoo anticipates that subsequent events and developments will cause Canoo's assessments to change. However, while Canoo may elect to update these forward-looking statements at some point in the future, Canoo specifically disclaims any obligation to do so unless required by law. These forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as representing Canoo's assessments as of any date subsequent to the date of this press release. Accordingly, undue reliance should not be placed upon the forward-looking statements.

Definition + Step-by-Step Guide What Is Competitor Analysis? Definition + Step-by-Step Guide Written by Coursera Staff • Updated on Jan 6, 2024Discover what goes into competitor analysis, how it benefits your business, and the steps to conducting a competitor analysis. What is a competitor analysis?A competitor analysis, also called competitive analysis and competition analysis, is the process of examining similar brands in your industry to gain insight into their offerings, branding, sales, and marketing approaches. Knowing your competitors in business analysis is important if you’re a business owner, marketer, start-up founder, or product developer. Benefits of conducting competitor analysisA competitor analysis offers several benefits, including: Understanding industry standards so that you can meet and exceed them   Discovering untapped niche markets  Differentiating products and servicesFulfilling customers’ desires and solving their problems better than competitorsDistinguishing your brandStanding out in your marketing Measuring your growth How to do a competitor analysis  The sections below provide a competitor analysis framework for evaluating your industry’s competitive landscape. Return to this framework regularly and apply the insights to develop your business.1. Find out who your competitors are. Start by reviewing your own business values, goals, branding, products, and services. That way, you can easily identify existing brands that target customers might choose over yours.  Next, turn to Google. Type in your product name or category. What brands and companies come up when you search ""hydrating lipstick"", for example? What comes up when you search social media channels for relevant hashtags or keywords?Using the information you gathered, make a list of up to 10 brands whose offerings most resemble yours and present your target customers with comparable alternatives. Identify potential direct competitors (those who sell a similar product to a similar audience) and indirect competitors (those who sell a different product to a similar audience).2. Analyze your competitors and their business structures. By examining how competitors structure their businesses, you can gauge how equipped they are to grow, gain market share, and earn customer loyalty in your target market. Review each competitor’s website and social media profile to gather the following information: 
How large is the company, in terms of the number of leaders and employees?How many years has the company been in operation? What job openings do these companies list on Glassdoor, Indeed, or LinkedIn? What are their areas of expansion?For publicly traded companies, you may be able to review their annual reports and gain insight into how much revenue they’re generating, their debt and liability, and other performance metrics. 
3. Evaluate your competitors and their value propositions. A value proposition is a short statement that summarizes the benefits of a product and why a customer would choose it over competing products. A value proposition often looks something like the following: We help [target customer] do [outcome, benefit, experience] by doing / offering [product or service].  In this section, you will understand competitors’ value propositions in order to ensure your product or service stands out in the marketplace. Review major competitors’ site copy, particularly on the ""About"" or What We Do"" pages, as well as analyzing any blogs and stories on their website. Answer these questions for each competitor: 
What problems and pain points do competitors’ products solve? What desires do the products fulfill? What benefits or outcomes does the product deliver for customers?What data do they cite to support their claims about products’ benefits?What pricing structure do competitors use? 4. Evaluate your competitors’ marketing efforts.Evaluate how competitors position themselves in the marketplace. This will allow you to create a marketing strategy that gets your brand in front of your target audience. 
For each competitor, answer these questions: What social media influencers does this company partner with to leverage their authority, authentic content, and personal connections to target customers?  What affiliate marketing or brand ambassador programs does this company offer to leverage the recommendations of satisfied customers? What kind of digital or traditional paid advertising presence does this company have?On what marketing channels do competitors publish organic content, including websites, landing pages, social media platforms, and email? What type of content do you see, including articles, videos, ebooks, reports, commercials, and digital ads?  Read more: Marketing Strategy: What It Is and How to Create One5. Audit your competitors’ brand identities.Get to know your competitors by auditing their brand identities and getting a sense of why customers might feel connected (and loyal) to that brand.
For each competitor, answers these questions: 
If this company were a person, how would you describe its personality? What words, phrases, tone, and style does this company use in its messaging?  What values do competitors communicate through their messaging? How would you describe the visual elements of this company’s branding? And how do those elements correspond to the brand’s values, voice, and personality? What emotions do the brand elements evoke in customers? Read more: What Is a Brand Strategy? And How to Create One6. Follow each competitor’s customer journey. Study the customer journeys that your competitors have set up to nurture and convert customers. Your goal is to gauge how seamless, integrated, and logical it is to go from the first touchpoint to making a purchase and beyond.   
Start by following your competitors on social media, subscribing to them via email, and purchasing products and services to experience each customer journey for yourself. 
As you experience the customer journey for each competitor, gather information on the following: What are the different touchpoints along this company’s customer journey?What elements make it easy to keep moving along the customer journey? What calls to action and instructions are there to make it clear how to proceed?What kinds of content educate and entertain you at each touchpoint?What elements create friction or make it difficult to advance to the next step?What do you experience after subscribing or making a purchase? Do you find customer support, upsells, and access to a community? 7. Examine audience engagement. In this step, you will scour competitors’ customer reviews, reactions, and comments on their social media posts, social media mentions, media appearances, and even employee reviews on job sites to understand the perception of competitors in the marketplace. With this information, you can strategize how to garner a positive reputation for your brand, learn from competitors’ mistakes and challenges, and work to avoid any pitfalls yourself. 
For each competitor, explore the following:
How do followers and subscribers interact with this company’s public content?What is the general public sentiment regarding this company, based on mentions, product reviews, and social media likes and comments? Include praise as well as complaints. What experiences do employees have, based on reviews on job sites like Glassdoor and Indeed? 
Share of voice measures how much of the market your brand owns compared to competitors. By determining the share of voice, you can gauge how visible, authoritative, and popular your brand is in the marketplace.8. Conduct a SWOT analysis of your competition.A SWOT analysis is a classic exercise for identifying the Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats that exist within the competitive landscape. Conduct a SWOT analysis of your competitors to consolidate everything you’ve learned into a succinct story. What strengths do you see in competitors’ branding, marketing, customer journeys, and products?What weaknesses do you see in competitors’ branding, marketing, customer journeys, and products?What opportunities do you see for your business to capitalize on?What is your competition doing that might pose a threat to your business?You can also list the strengths and weaknesses of your business as it currently stands and compare them side-by-side with those of competitors. 
 For more on SWOT analysis, watch this video from the Business Strategy Specialization:How to use competitor analysis Once you’ve conducted a competitor analysis, your next step is to apply the insights to your business. Use the following prompts to differentiate your brand, products, and services from competitors and gain market share:
What product features can you add that differentiate your product from competitors?What pricing strategy can you use to attract new customers to your offerings?What design features can you add to your brand to make it stand out?How can you compose a value proposition that stands out from competitors? We help [target customer] do [outcome, benefit, experience] by doing / offering [product or service].  How can you design a more seamless, frictionless customer journey that leads consumers to make a purchase and become loyal brand ambassadors? How can you create content that improves on that of your competitors, including covering new topics, addressing ignored pain points, recommending new solutions, and offering more exciting experiences?  How can you improve your social media strategy to reach new potential customers?What approaches can you take on marketing channels where your competitors have a presence to distinguish your messaging and present your offerings as the best choice?On which marketing channels do your competitors not (yet) have a presence? What steps can you take to establish and grow a presence on those channels? Competitor analysis key takeawaysRemember that conducting a competitor analysis is a crucial step in developing your business. It can help you differentiate your brand and present your products and services as the best on the market. Return to your competitor analysis efforts regularly, such as every quarter, six months, or year, to account for shifts in competitors’ tactics and new competitors that arrive on the scene. Always look for ways to give your brand and products a competitive edge. Build key marketing skills for your career or business on CourseraKeep learning about marketing and its role in business with the top-rated courses and Professional Certificates on Coursera: Stay on top of your industry’s evolution by enrolling in the University of Virginia's Business Strategy Specialization.

What is a competitive market analysis?

A competitive analysis is a strategy that involves researching major competitors to gain insight into their products, sales, and marketing tactics. Implementing stronger business strategies, warding off competitors, and capturing market share are just a few benefits of conducting a competitive market analysis.




A competitive analysis can help you learn the ins and outs of how your competition works and identify potential opportunities where you can outperform them. It also enables you to stay atop of industry trends and ensure your product is consistently meeting — and exceeding — industry standards.

Let's dive into a few more benefits of conducting competitive analyses:

Helps you identify your product's unique value proposition and what makes your product different from your competitors, which can inform future marketing efforts.


Enables you to identify what your competitor is doing right. This information is critical for staying relevant and ensuring your product and marketing campaigns outperform industry standards.
Tells you where your competitors are falling short — which helps you identify areas of opportunities in the marketplace and test out new, unique marketing strategies they haven't taken advantage of.
Learn through customer reviews what‘s missing in a competitor’s product, and consider how you might add features to your own product to meet those needs.
Provides you with a benchmark against which you can measure your growth.


What is a competitive analysis?
Competitive analysis is a meticulous strategy that dives deep into the operations of your prime competitors.
It's not just about knowing what they offer. You need to understand their sales strategies, marketing tactics, and the ethos driving their brand.

Why is a competitive analysis important?
The ripple effects of a well-executed competitive analysis are manifold:

Strategic business decisions. Anchoring your business strategies on solid, data-driven insights ensures you stay ahead in the game.
Fortifying defenses. By knowing what your competitors are up to, you can better defend your market share and even capture new territories.
Unearth golden opportunities. Delving into the intricacies of your competition’s operations can spotlight areas where you can shine brighter.

Beyond Just the Basics
While it's essential to understand how your competition operates, the real magic happens when you can:

Spot your unique value. What sets you apart? How can you amplify that difference in your marketing efforts?
Learn from their triumphs. Your competitors might just be doing something genius. Identifying their strengths ensures you're always at par, if not ahead.
Discover their shortcomings. Every brand has its Achilles' heel. Find it. This knowledge can carve out opportunities and new strategies for your business.
Tap into customer sentiments. Dive into customer reviews. What’s lacking in their product? Can you incorporate those missing features into your offerings?
Benchmark your progress. Your journey is unique. However, setting a benchmark based on your competitors can offer valuable growth metrics.


What is competitive market research?
Competitive market research is a vital exercise that goes beyond merely comparing products or services.
It involves an in-depth analysis of the market metrics that distinguish your offerings from those of your competitors.
A thorough market research doesn't just highlight these differences but leverages them, laying a solid foundation for a sales and marketing strategy that truly differentiates your business in a bustling market.
In the next section, we’ll explore the nuts and bolts of conducting a detailed competitive analysis tailored to your brand.

Competitive Analysis in Marketing
Every brand can benefit from regular competitor analysis. By performing a competitor analysis, you'll be able to:

Identify gaps in the market.
Develop new products and services.
Uncover market trends.
Market and sell more effectively.

As you can see, learning any of these four components will lead your brand down the path of achievement.
Next, let's dive into some steps you can take to conduct a comprehensive competitive analysis.



How to Do a Competitive Analysis


Determine who your competitors are.
Determine what products your competitors offer.
Research your competitors' sales tactics and results.
Take a look at your competitors' pricing, as well as any perks they offer.
Ensure you're meeting competitive shipping costs.
Analyze how your competitors market their products.
Take note of your competition's content strategy.
Learn what technology stack your competitors use.
Analyze the level of engagement on your competitors' content.
Observe how they promote marketing content.
Look at their social media presence, strategies, and go-to platforms.
Perform a SWOT Analysis to learn their strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats.

1. Determine who your competitors are.
First, you‘ll need to figure out who you’re competing with to compare the data accurately. What works in a business like yours may not work for your brand.
So how can you do this?
Divide your “competitors” into two categories: direct and indirect.
Direct competitors are businesses that offer a product or service that could pass as a similar substitute for yours and that operate in your same geographic area.
On the flip side, an indirect competitor provides products that are not the same but could satisfy the same customer need or solve the same problem.
It seems simple enough on paper, but these two terms are often misused.
When comparing your brand, you should only focus on your direct competitors. This is something many brands get wrong.
Let's use an example: Stitch Fix and Fabletics are both subscription-based services that sell clothes on a monthly basis and serve a similar target audience.
But as we look deeper, we can see that the actual product (clothes in this case) is not the same; one brand focuses on stylish everyday outfits while the other is workout-centric attire only.
Yes, these brands satisfy the same need for women (having trendy clothes delivered right to their doorstep each month), but they do so with completely different types of clothing, making them indirect competitors.
This means Kate Hudson‘s team at Fabletics would not want to spend their time studying Stitch Fix too closely since their audiences probably vary quite a bit. Even if it’s only slightly, this tiny variation is enough to make a big difference.
Now, this doesn't mean you should toss your indirect competitors out the window completely.
Keep these brands on your radar since they could shift positions at any time and cross over into the direct competitor zone. Using our example, Stitch Fix could start a workout line, which would certainly change things for Fabletics.
This is also one of the reasons why you‘ll want to routinely run a competitor analysis. The market can and will shift at any time, and if you’re not constantly scoping it out, you won‘t be aware of these changes until it’s too late.

2. Determine what products your competitors offer.
At the heart of any business is its product or service, which is what makes this a good place to start.
You‘ll want to analyze your competitor’s complete product line and the quality of the products or services they're offering.
You should also take note of their pricing and any discounts they're offering customers.
Some questions to consider include:

Are they a low-cost or high-cost provider?
Are they working mainly on volume sales or one-off purchases?
What is their market share?
What are the characteristics and needs of their ideal customers?
Are they using different pricing strategies for online purchases versus brick-and-mortar?
How does the company differentiate itself from its competitors?
How do they distribute their products/services?

3. Research your competitors' sales tactics and results.
Running a sales analysis of your competitors can be a bit tricky.
You'll want to track down the answers to questions such as:

What does the sales process look like?
What channels are they selling through?
Do they have multiple locations, and how does this give them an advantage?
Are they expanding? Scaling down?
Do they have partner reselling programs?
What are their customers' reasons for not buying? For ending their relationship with the company?
What are their revenues each year? What about total sales volume?
Do they regularly discount their products or services?
How involved is a salesperson in the process?

These helpful pieces of information will give you an idea of how competitive the sales process is and what information you need to prepare your sales reps with to compete during the final buy stage.
For publicly held companies, you can find annual reports online, but you'll have to do some sleuthing to find this info from privately owned businesses.
You could find some of this information by searching through your CRM and reaching out to those customers who mentioned they were considering your competitor.
Find out what made them choose your product or service over others out there.
To do this, run a report that shows all prospective deals where there was an identified competitor.
If this data is not something you currently record, talk to marketing and sales to implement a system where prospects are questioned about the other companies they are considering.
Essentially, they‘ll need to ask their leads (either through a form field or during a one-on-one sales conversation) to identify who their current service providers are, who they’ve used in the past, and who else they are considering during the buying process.
When a competitor is identified, have your sales team dive deeper by asking why they are considering switching to your product. If you've already lost the deal, be sure to follow up with the prospect to determine why you lost to your competitor.
What services or features attracted the prospect? Was it about price? What‘s the prospect’s impression of your sales process? If they've already made the switch, find out why they made this decision.
By asking open-ended questions, you'll have honest feedback about what customers find appealing about your brand and what might be turning customers away.
Once you‘ve answered these questions, you can start scoping out your competitor’s marketing efforts.
4. Take a look at your competitors' pricing, as well as any perks they offer.
There are a few major factors that go into correctly pricing your product — and one major one is understanding how much your competitors are charging for a similar product or service.
If you feel your product offers superior features compared to those of a competitor, you might consider making your product or service more expensive than industry standards.
However, if you do that, you'll want to ensure your sales reps are ready to explain why your product is worth the additional cost.
Alternatively, perhaps you feel there‘s a gap in your industry for affordable products. If that’s the case, you might aim to charge less than competitors and appeal to prospects who aren't looking to break the bank for a high-quality product.
Of course, other factors go into correctly pricing a product, but it‘s critical you stay on top of industry pricing to ensure you’re pricing your product in a way that feels reasonable to prospects.
Additionally, take a look at any perks your competitors offer and how you might match those perks to compete. For instance, perhaps your competitors offer a major referral discount or a month-long free trial version.
These perks could be the reason you‘re losing customers, so if it feels reasonable for your brand, consider where you might match those perks — or provide some unique perks of your own if competitors don’t offer any.
5. Ensure you're meeting competitive shipping costs.
Did you know expensive shipping is the number one reason for cart abandonment?
Nowadays, free shipping is a major perk that can attract consumers to choose one brand over another. If you work in an industry where shipping is a major factor — like e-commerce — you‘ll want to take a look at competitors’ shipping costs and ensure you're meeting (if not exceeding) those prices.
If most of your competitors offer free shipping, you‘ll want to look into the option for your own company. If free shipping isn’t a practical option for your business, consider how you might differentiate in other ways — including loyalty programs, holiday discounts, or giveaways on social media.

6. Analyze how your competitors market their products.
Analyzing your competitor's website is the fastest way to gauge their marketing efforts. Take note of any of the following items and copy down the specific URL for future reference:

Do they have a blog?
Are they creating whitepapers or e-books?
Do they post videos or webinars?
Do they have a podcast?
Are they using static visual content such as infographics and cartoons?
What about slide decks?
Do they have a FAQs section?
Are there featured articles?
Do you see press releases?
Do they have a media kit?
What about case studies?
Do they publish buying guides and data sheets?
What online and offline advertising campaigns are they running?

7. Take note of your competition's content strategy.
Then, take a look at the quantity of these items. Do they have several hundred blog posts or a small handful? Are there five white papers and just one e-book?
Next, determine the frequency of these content assets. Are they publishing something new each week or once a month? How often does a new e-book or case study come out?
Chances are, if you come across a robust archive of content, your competitor has been publishing regularly. Depending on the topics they're discussing, this content may help you hone in on their lead-generating strategies.
From there, you should move on to evaluating the quality of their content. After all, if the quality is lacking, it won‘t matter how often they post since their target audience won’t find much value in it.
Choose a small handful of samples to review instead of tackling every single piece to make the process more manageable.
Your sampler should include content pieces covering a variety of topics, so you'll have a fairly complete picture of what your competitor shares with their target audience.
When analyzing your competitor's content, consider the following questions:

How accurate is their content?
Are spelling or grammar errors present?
How in-depth does their content go? (Is it at the introductory level that just scratches the surface, or does it include more advanced topics with high-level ideas?)
What tone do they use?
Is the content structured for readability? (Are they using bullet points, bold headings, and numbered lists?)
Is their content free and available to anyone, or do their readers need to opt in?
Who is writing their content? (In-house team? One person? Multiple contributors?)
Is there a visible byline or bio attached to their articles?

As you continue to scan the content, pay attention to the photos and imagery your competitors are using.
Do you quickly scroll past generic stock photos, or are you impressed by custom illustrations and images? If they're using stock photos, do they at least have overlays of text quotes or calls-to-action that are specific to their business?
If their photos are custom, are they sourced from outside graphic professionals, or do they appear to be done in-house?
When you have a solid understanding of your competitor‘s content marketing strategy, it’s time to find out if it's truly working for them.
8. Learn what technology stack your competitors use.
Understanding what types of technology your competitors use can be critical for helping your own company reduce friction and increase momentum within your organization.
For instance, perhaps you‘ve seen positive reviews about a competitor’s customer service — as you're conducting research, you learn the customer uses powerful customer service software you haven't been taking advantage of.
This information should arm you with the opportunity to outperform your competitors' processes.
To figure out which software your competitors use, type the company's URL into Built With, an effective tool for unveiling what technology your competitors' site runs on, along with third-party plugins ranging from analytics systems to CRMs.
Alternatively, you might consider looking at competitors' job listings, particularly for engineer or web developer roles. The job listing will likely mention which tools a candidate needs to be familiar with — a creative way to gain intel into the technology your competitors use.
9. Analyze the level of engagement on your competitor's content.
To gauge how engaging your competitor‘s content is to their readers, you’ll need to see how their target audience responds to what they're posting.
Check the average number of comments, shares, and likes on your competitor's content and find out if:

Certain topics resonate better than others.
The comments are negative, positive, or mixed.
People are tweeting about specific topics more than others.
Readers respond better to Facebook updates about certain content.
Don't forget to note if your competitor categorizes their content using tags and if they have social media follow and share buttons attached to each piece of content.

10. Observe how they promote their marketing content.
From engagement, you‘ll move right along to your competitor’s content promotion strategy.

Keyword density in the copy itself
Image ALT text tags
Use of internal linking

The following questions can also help you prioritize and focus on what to pay attention to:

Which keywords are your competitors focusing on that you still haven't tapped into?
What content of theirs is highly shared and linked to? How does your content compare?
Which social media platforms are your target audience using?
What other sites are linking back to your competitor's site but not yours?
Who else is sharing what your competitors are publishing?
Who is referring traffic to your competitor's site?
For the keywords you want to focus on, what is the difficulty level? There are several free (and paid) tools that will give you a comprehensive evaluation of your competitor's search engine optimization.

11. Look at their social media presence, strategies, and go-to platforms
The last area you‘ll want to evaluate when it comes to marketing is your competitor’s social media presence and engagement rates.
How does your competition drive engagement with their brand through social media? Do you see social sharing buttons with each article? Does your competitor have links to their social media channels in the header, footer, or somewhere else? Are these clearly visible? Do they use calls-to-action with these buttons?
If your competitors are using a social network that you may not be on, it's worth learning more about how that platform may be able to help your business, too.
To determine if a new social media platform is worth your time, check your competitor's engagement rates on those sites. First, visit the following sites to see if your competition has an account on these platforms:

Facebook.
Twitter.
Instagram.
Snapchat.
LinkedIn.
YouTube.
Pinterest.

Then, take note of the following quantitative items from each platform:

Number of fans/followers.
Posting frequency and consistency.
Content engagement. (Are users leaving comments or sharing their posts?)
Content virality. (How many shares, repins, and retweets do their posts get?)

With the same critical eye you used to gauge your competition's content marketing strategy, take a fine-toothed comb to analyze their social media strategy.
What kind of content are they posting? Are they more focused on driving people to landing pages, resulting in new leads? Or are they posting visual content to promote engagement and brand awareness?
How much of this content is original? Do they share curated content from other sources? Are these sources regular contributors? What is the overall tone of the content?
How does your competition interact with its followers? How frequently do their followers interact with their content?
After you collect this data, generate an overall grade for the quality of your competitor's content. This will help you compare the rest of your competitors using a similar grading scale.
12. Perform a SWOT Analysis to learn their strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats
As you evaluate each component in your competitor analysis (business, sales, and marketing), get into the habit of performing a simplified SWOT analysis at the same time.
This means you‘ll take note of your competitor’s strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats any time you assess an overall grade.
Some questions to get you started include:

What is your competitor doing well? (Products, content marketing, social
Where does your competitor have the advantage over your brand?
What is the weakest area for your competitor?
Where does your brand have the advantage over your competitor?
What could they do better with?
In what areas would you consider this competitor a threat?
Are there opportunities in the market that your competitor has identified?

You‘ll be able to compare their weaknesses against your strengths and vice versa. By doing this, you can better position your company, and you’ll start to uncover areas for improvement within your own brand.

Competitive Product Analysis
Product analysis drills down to discover key differences and similarities in products that share the same general market.
If you have a competitor selling products in a similar market niche to your own — you want to ensure that you aren’t losing market share to the competition.
Leveraging the example above, we can drill down and discover some of the key differentiators in product offerings.

Step 1: Assess your current product pricing.
The first step in any product analysis is to assess current pricing.
Nintendo offers three models of its Switch console: The smaller lite version is priced at $199, the standard version is $299, and the new OLED version is $349.
Sony, meanwhile, offers two versions of its PlayStation 5 console: The standard edition costs $499, and the digital version, which doesn’t include a disc drive, is $399.
Step 2: Compare key features
Next is a comparison of key features. In the case of our console example, this means comparing features like processing power, memory, and hard drive space.




Feature


PS5 Standard


Nintendo Switch




Hard drive space


825 GB


32 GB




RAM


16 GB


4 GB




USB ports


4 ports


1 USB 3.0, 2 USB 2.0




Ethernet connection


Gigabit


None




Step 3: Pinpoint differentiators
With basic features compared, it’s time to dive deeper with differentiators. While a glance at the chart above seems to indicate that the PS5 is outperforming its competition, this data only tells part of the story.
Here’s why: The big selling point of the standard and OLED Switch models is that they can be played as either handheld consoles or docked with a base station connected to a TV. What’s more, this “switching” happens seamlessly, allowing players to play whenever, wherever.
The Playstation offering, meanwhile, has leaned into market-exclusive games that are only available on its system to help differentiate them from their competitors.
Step 4: Identify market gaps
The last step in a competitive product analysis is looking for gaps in the market that could help your company get ahead.
When it comes to the console market, one potential opportunity gaining traction is the delivery of games via cloud-based services rather than physical hardware.
Companies like Nvidia and Google have already made inroads in this space, and if they can overcome issues with bandwidth and latency, it could change the market at scale.

Competitive Analysis Example
How do you stack up against the competition? Where are you similar, and what sets you apart? This is the goal of competitive analysis.
By understanding where your brand and competitors overlap and diverge, you’re better positioned to make strategic decisions that can help grow your brand.
Of course, it’s one thing to understand the benefits of competitive analysis, and it’s another to actually carry out an analysis that yields actionable results. Don’t worry — we’ve got you covered with a quick example.

Let’s take a look at popular gaming system companies Sony and Nintendo.
Sony’s newest offering — the Playstation 5 — recently hit the market but has been plagued by supply shortages.
Nintendo’s Switch console, meanwhile, has been around for several years but remains a consistent seller, especially among teens and children.
This scenario is familiar for many companies on both sides of the coin; some have introduced new products designed to compete with established market leaders, while others are looking to ensure that reliable sales don’t fall.
Using some of the steps listed above, here’s a quick competitive analysis example.
1. Determine who your competitors are.
In our example, it’s Sony vs Nintendo, but it’s also worth considering Microsoft’s Xbox, which occupies the same general market vertical.
This is critical for effective analysis; even if you’re focused on specific competitors and how they compare, it’s worth considering other similar market offerings.
2. Determine what products your competitors offer.
PlayStation offers two PS5 versions, digital and standard, at different price points, while Nintendo offers three versions of its console.
Both companies also sell peripherals — for example, Sony sells virtual reality (VR) add-ons, while Nintendo sells gaming peripherals such as steering wheels, tennis rackets, and differing controller configurations.
3. Research your competitors' sales tactics and results.
When it comes to sales tactics and marketing, Sony and Nintendo have very different approaches.
In part thanks to the recent semiconductor shortage, Sony has driven up demand via scarcity — very low volumes of PS5 consoles remain available. Nintendo, meanwhile, has adopted a broader approach by targeting families as its primary customer base.
This effort is bolstered by the Switch Lite product line, which is smaller and less expensive, making it a popular choice for children.
The numbers tell the tale: Through September 2021, Nintendo sold 14.3 million consoles, while Sony sold 7.8 million.
4. Take a look at your competitors' pricing, as well as any perks they offer.
Sony has the higher price point: Their standard PS5 sells for $499, while Nintendo’s most expensive offering comes in at $349. Both offer robust digital marketplaces and the ability to easily download new games or services.
Here, the key differentiators are flexibility and fidelity. The Switch is flexible — users can dock it with their television and play it like a standard console or pick it up and take it anywhere as a handheld gaming system.
The PS5, meanwhile, has superior graphics hardware and processing power for gamers who want the highest-fidelity experience.
5. Analyze how your competitors market their products.
If you compare the marketing efforts of Nintendo and Sony, the difference is immediately apparent: Sony’s ads feature realistic in-game footage and speak to the exclusive nature of their game titles.
The company has managed to secure deals with several high-profile game developers for exclusive access to new and existing IPs.
Nintendo, meanwhile, uses brightly lit ads showing happy families playing together or children using their smaller Switches while traveling.
6. Analyze the level of engagement on your competitor's content.
Engagement helps drive sales and encourage repeat purchases.
While there are several ways to measure engagement, social media is one of the most straightforward: In general, more followers equates to more engagement and greater market impact.
When it comes to our example, Sony enjoys a significant lead over Nintendo: While the official Playstation Facebook page has 38 million followers, Nintendo has just 5 million.

Competitive Analysis Templates
Competitive analysis is complex, especially when you’re assessing multiple companies and products simultaneously.
To help streamline the process, we’ve created 10 free templates that make it possible to see how you stack up against the competition — and what you can do to increase market share.
Let’s break down our SWOT analysis template. Here’s what it looks like:

Download Free Templates
Strengths. Identify your strengths. These may include specific pieces of intellectual property, products that are unique to the market, or a workforce that outperforms the competition.
Weaknesses. Here, it’s worth considering potential issues around pricing, leadership, staff turnover, and new competitors in the market.
Opportunities. This part of the SWOT analysis can focus on new market niches, evolving consumer preferences, or new technologies being developed by your company.
Threats. These might include new taxes or regulations on existing products or an increasing number of similar products in the same market space that could negatively affect your overall share.

Competitive Analysis: FAQs
What is a competitive analysis framework?
A competitive analysis framework is a structured approach used to evaluate potential competitors and understand their strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats.
This framework serves as a guide for businesses to identify competitive advantages, understand market positioning, and inform strategic decisions.
Depending on the industry and the company's objectives, this framework might focus on areas like product features, market share, pricing, customer feedback, and more.
How do you do a good competitive analysis?
Conducting a thorough competitive analysis involves several steps:

Identify competitors. Start by listing key competitors in your market, both direct and indirect.
Evaluate their products/services. Analyze what they're selling and how it compares to your offerings.
Analyze market position. Determine their market share, brand perception, and unique value proposition.
Check their marketing strategies. Observe their advertising, content marketing, PR efforts, and online presence.
Assess their financial health. If available, review financial statements, annual reports, or investor presentations.
Gather customer feedback. Reviews, testimonials, and surveys can give insights into competitor strengths and weaknesses.
Regularly review and update. The market evolves, and competitors change strategies, so it's vital to keep your analysis current.

What are the 5 parts of a competitive analysis?
The five key components of a competitive analysis include:

Company overview. A brief snapshot of the competitor, including its history, size, and mission.
Product/service analysis. An examination of their key products or services and how they compare to yours.
Marketing strategy. Insights into their promotional tactics, target audience, and unique selling propositions.
Operational analysis. An understanding of their supply chain, distribution, and customer service practices.
Strengths and weaknesses. A clear breakdown of where the competitor excels and where they might be vulnerable.

What are the 3 C's in a competitive analysis?
The 3 C's refer to a strategic model that considers three main factors when understanding the broader business environment:

Company. Understanding your own strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats.
Customers. Knowing who your target audience is, what they value, and how they behave.
Competitors. Analyzing direct and indirect competitors to determine market dynamics and potential threats.

Is SWOT analysis a competitive analysis?
Yes, SWOT analysis is a type of competitive analysis. SWOT stands for Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats. It is a strategic planning tool used to identify and analyze these four elements of a business.
While a SWOT analysis can be focused internally on a company‘s own attributes, when used as a competitive analysis tool, it assesses a competitor’s SWOT to understand where your business has advantages or might be vulnerable.
How does your business stack up?
Before you accurately compare your competition, you need to establish a baseline. This also helps when it comes time to perform a SWOT analysis.
Take an objective look at your business, sales, and marketing reports through the same metrics you use to evaluate your competition. Record this information just like you would with a competitor and use this as your baseline to compare across the board.

Accelerating revenue generation phase
Delivering first units to state of Oklahoma as part of up to 1,000-unit agreement
Commissioned ladder frame and battery lines

JUSTIN, Texas, Nov. 14, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Canoo Inc. (Nasdaq: GOEV), a high-tech mobility company, today announced its financial results for the third quarter of 2023.

  

""We are now in our manufacturing and revenue-generation phase, while we still have things left to prove. We have worked nearly three years to get to this point,"" said Tony Aquila, Investor, Executive Chairman and CEO of Canoo. ""The bets we have made around the redesign and functionality of our platform are beginning to play out successfully at multiple levels. We continue to move toward our goal of achieving 20,000 annual unit capacity. I think that's a tribute to the scrappiness of our team driving value to our customers and partners.""
Third Quarter & Recent Business Updates:

Crossed above 10,000 industrial and commercial-use miles in pilot and customer delivery testing
EPA permit granted for Oklahoma City facility
Began assembling workforce at Oklahoma facilities, expecting 20-25% of company to be Oklahoma-based by end of Q4 2023

Third Quarter Financial Highlights:

As of September 30, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents of $8.3 million. After giving effect to the preferred stock and warrant subscription agreement for a total of $45.0 million, our cash balance would have been $53.3 million on September 30, 2023.
GAAP net loss and comprehensive loss of $(112.0) million and $(273.6) million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, compared to a GAAP net loss and comprehensive loss of $(117.7) million and $(407.5) million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022. The GAAP net loss and comprehensive loss for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 included a gain of $17.1 million and $40.1 million on the fair value change of the warrant and derivative liability, respectively and a gain of $0.3 million and $2.8 million on the fair value change in contingent earnout shares liability, respectively.
Adjusted EBITDA of $(40.4) million and $(169.8) million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, compared to $(80.8) million and $(348.1) million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022.
Adjusted Net Loss of $(46.1) million and $(187.2) million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, compared to $(86.5) million and $(359.3) million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022.
GAAP Net Loss per share of $(0.18) and $(0.53) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, compared to $(0.43) and $(1.62) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022.
Adjusted EPS per share of $(0.07) and $(0.36) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, compared to $(0.31) and $(1.43) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022.
Net cash used in operating activities totaled $191.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, compared to $329.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022.
Net cash used in investing activities was $45.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, compared to $58.4 million net cash used in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2022.

Second Half 2023 Business Outlook - Updated
Based upon our current projections, we have updated our previously provided second half 2023 guidance as follows: 

Adjusted EBITDA: $(85) million to $(105) million
Capital Expenditures of: $30 million to $40 million

See ""Non-GAAP Financial Measures"" section herein for an explanation of Adjusted EBITDA. The Company is unable to provide a reconciliation for forward-looking guidance of Adjusted EBITDA to net loss, the most closely comparable GAAP measure, because certain material reconciling items, such as depreciation and amortization and interest expense cannot be estimated due to factors outside of the Company's control and could have a material impact on the reported results. A reconciliation is not available without unreasonable effort.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net  Loss and Adjusted Earnings Per Share (""EPS"")
""EBITDA"" is defined as net loss before interest expense, income tax expense or benefit, and depreciation and amortization. ""Adjusted EBITDA"" is defined as EBITDA adjusted for stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, asset impairments, non-routine legal fees, and other costs associated with exit and disposal activities, acquisition and related costs, changes to the fair value of contingent earnout shares liability, changes to the fair value of warrant and derivative liability, changes to the fair value of the derivative asset, changes to the fair value of convertible debt, loss on extinguishment of debt, and any other one-time non-recurring transaction amounts impacting the statement of operations during the year. ""Adjusted Net Loss"" is defined as net loss adjusted for  stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, asset impairments, non-routine legal fees, and other costs associated with exit and disposal activities, acquisition and related costs, changes to the fair value of contingent earnout shares liability, changes to the fair value of warrants and derivative liability, changes to the fair value of the derivative asset, changes to the fair value of convertible debt, loss on extinguishment of debt, and any other one-time non-recurring transaction amounts impacting the statement of operations during the year. ""Adjusted EPS"" is defined as Adjusted Net Loss on a per share basis using the weighted average shares outstanding.
EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS are intended as a supplemental measure of our performance that is neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. We believe EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA,  Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS when combined with net loss and net loss per share are beneficial to an investor's complete understanding of our operating performance. We believe that the use of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA,  Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial measures with those of comparable companies, which may present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. However, you should be aware that when evaluating EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS we may incur future expenses similar to those excluded when calculating these measures. In addition, our presentation of these measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Our computation of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures computed by other companies, because all companies may not calculate EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS in the same fashion.
Because of these limitations, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. We manage our business utilizing EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS as supplemental performance measures.

The information in this press release includes ""forward-looking statements"" within the meaning of the ""safe harbor"" provisions of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of words such as ""estimate,"" ""plan,"" ""project,"" ""forecast,"" ""intend,"" ""will,"" ""expect,"" ""anticipate,"" ""believe,"" ""seek,"" ""target"" or other similar expressions that predict or indicate future events or trends or that are not statements of historical matters.

These statements are based on various assumptions, whether or not identified in this press release, and on the current expectations of Canoo's management and are not predictions of actual performance. These forward-looking statements are provided for illustrative purposes only and are not intended to serve as, and must not be relied on by any investor as, a guarantee, an assurance, a prediction or a definitive statement of fact or probability. Actual events and circumstances are difficult or impossible to predict and will differ from assumptions. Many actual events and circumstances are beyond the control of Canoo. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including changes in domestic and foreign business, market, financial, political and legal conditions; Canoo's ability to continue as a going concern; Canoo's ability to access existing and future sources of capital via debt or equity markets, which will impact execution of its business plans and could require Canoo to terminate or significantly curtail its operations; Canoo's history of losses; Canoo's ability to adequately control the costs associated with its operations; Canoo's ability to successfully build and tool its manufacturing facilities, establish or continue a relationship with a contract manufacturer or failure of operation of Canoo's facilities ; the rollout of Canoo's business and the timing of expected business milestones and commercial launch; future market adoption of Canoo's offerings; risks related to Canoo's go-to-market strategy and manufacturing strategy; the effects of competition on Canoo's future business, and those factors discussed  under the captions ""Risk Factors"" and ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations"" in Canoo's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC"") on March 30, 2023, as well as its past and future Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and other filings with the SEC, copies of which may be obtained by visiting Canoo's Investors Relations website at investors.canoo.com or the SEC's website at www.sec.gov. If any of these risks materialize or our assumptions prove incorrect, actual results could differ materially from the results implied by these forward-looking statements. There may be additional risks that Canoo does not presently know or that Canoo currently believes are immaterial that could also cause actual results to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements. In addition, forward-looking statements reflect Canoo's expectations, plans or forecasts of future events and views as of the date of this press release. Canoo anticipates that subsequent events and developments will cause Canoo's assessments to change. However, while Canoo may elect to update these forward-looking statements at some point in the future, Canoo specifically disclaims any obligation to do so. These forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as representing Canoo's assessments as of any date subsequent to the date of this press release. Accordingly, undue reliance should not be placed upon the forward-looking statements.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA
""EBITDA"" is defined as net loss before interest expense, income tax expense or benefit, and depreciation and amortization. ""Adjusted EBITDA"" is defined as EBITDA adjusted for stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, asset impairments, and other costs associated with exit and disposal activities, acquisition and related costs, changes to the fair value of contingent earnout shares liability, and any other one-time non-recurring transaction amounts impacting the statement of operations during the year. Adjusted EBITDA is intended as a supplemental measure of our performance that is neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. We believe Adjusted EBITDA, when combined with net loss, and EBITDA, is beneficial to an investor's complete understanding of our operating performance. We believe that the use of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial measures with those of comparable companies, which may present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. However, you should be aware that when evaluating EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA we may incur future expenses similar to those excluded when calculating these measures. In addition, our presentation of these measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Our computation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures computed by other companies, because all companies may not calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in the same fashion.
Because of these limitations, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. We manage our business utilizing EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as supplemental performance measures.

"Identify key trends in the market, including changes in consumer behavior, technological advancements, and shifts in the competitive landscape.",Four trends in consumer behavior in 2023 | McKinsey,https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/consumer-packaged-goods/our-insights/the-world-of-ands-consumers-set-the-tone,"Four trends in consumer behavior in 2023 | McKinsey

Skip to main contentThe world of ‘ands’: Consumers set the toneJune 8, 2023 | Commentary Sajal KohliConsumer behaviors are diverging in sometimes paradoxical directions. How can companies quickly detect—and respond to—these trends?  (4 pages)
This is an edited version of a presentation given at the Consumer Goods Forum in Kyoto, Japan, on June 7, 2023.
Leading consumer-facing businesses place a lot of emphasis on listening to consumers, as they should. Consumer sentiment and behavior can be fast changing, confusing, and sometimes contradictory. Today’s consumers, for instance, are both trading down and selectively splurging. They’re buying big, established brands and exploring newer, smaller ones. Many of their buying decisions are a matter of “and,” not “or.”
Staying attuned to these trends in consumer behavior can be difficult for companies, but doing so is absolutely critical—even (or perhaps especially) when the ands seem paradoxical. Quick decision making on how to meet consumers’ expectations in this world of ands must be at the top of a company’s agenda.
In addition, businesses must prioritize a series of ands themselves to grow profitably and outperform competitors. This article outlines the ands that we see playing out in consumer behavior, along with the ands that business leaders need to act on.
Four trends in consumer behavior
Many of the insights I’ll be sharing with you are powered by ConsumerWise, McKinsey’s proprietary solution that tracks and analyzes both consumer sentiment (what consumers say and how they feel) and consumer spending (what they actually do)—thus providing a 360-degree view of today’s consumers. ConsumerWise currently spans ten markets; by the end of 2023 it will expand to 20 markets, covering 90 percent of global GDP. Our latest ConsumerWise research reveals that consumers are engaging in the following four ands. It also reveals that trade-offs are false choices.
Trading down and splurging selectively

Consumers are both flocking to value and buying premium products and services. Worldwide, approximately two in three consumers are trading down by buying cheaper brands or private-label products. In Europe, 84 percent of consumers perceive branded products as having similar quality to private labels. In China, consumers are becoming more value conscious and aggressively seeking discounts and promotions.
At the same time, 44 percent of consumers around the world (and 60 percent of Gen Zers and millennials) say that they plan to splurge, particularly on purchases that are experiential or provide immediate gratification—think restaurants or travel. Regionally, intent to splurge closely aligns with economic optimism: 77 percent of Indian consumers plan to splurge, compared with only 26 percent of Japanese consumers. In short, consumer spending is falling globally, and midpriced goods and services are most at risk. Shoppers who splurge in some categories may seek value in others, which means companies must develop a detailed and nuanced understanding of trends and segments.
Shopping everywhere and all at once
The majority of consumers now use at least three channels for each purchase journey. And while 75 percent of consumers want a seamless omnichannel experience, only 25 percent are satisfied with the experience that retailers provide. Omnichannel excellence is especially important given that omnichannel consumers are at least 1.25 times more valuable than their single-channel counterparts.
Consumers are also increasingly adopting new shopping channels. More than 60 percent of US and Asian consumers plan to continue using channels that they first tried during the COVID-19 pandemic, such as grocery delivery or social commerce.
Finding comfort in familiarity and exploring brand promiscuity
Traditionally, big brands have dominated the consumer landscape, especially during times of uncertainty. In the US market, big brands grew 50 percent at the height of the pandemic. But consumers are also trying new brands: one in three consumers did so in the past three months. Gen Zers and millennials are especially susceptible to brand switching, as they are five times more likely than older generations to believe that newer brands are better or more innovative than established brands.
In general, consumers are now purchasing a repertoire of products to fill specific needs, instead of purchasing just one product. To illustrate: whereas ten years ago a typical household would have had just one type of milk in the fridge, a household today might buy cow’s milk, high-protein milk, and a plant-based alternative such as almond milk or oat milk—each for a unique occasion.
Demanding sustainability and affordability
Consumers are gravitating toward sustainable products: 84 percent say that sustainability is a very important factor in their purchase decisions. However, 50 percent say they’re not sure whether they would pay a premium for sustainable products in times of inflation.
Still, products making sustainability-related claims are growing faster than products that make no such claims. Companies face the challenge of striking a balance between sustainability and price, which is especially critical in an inflationary environment.
Three business imperatives
In addition to keeping their finger on the pulse of the ever-more-demanding consumer, businesses should respond to these trends with their own ands. Companies need to be uncompromising in the following three areas.
Choose growth and manage uncertainty
Approximately 60 percent of top-performing CEOs are concerned about an economic downturn. Even amid the highest global inflation since the 1970s, rising interest rates, geopolitical tensions, supply chain disruptions, and volatile commodity prices, investors continue to expect profitable growth above the historical average. Against this backdrop of uncertainty, CEOs have a unique opportunity to make distinctive decisions that lift their companies above competitors. Fortune favors the bold, and pursuing growth must be a conscious, strategic choice.
Companies are more likely to outperform peers when they pursue multiple pathways to growth, including expanding into new categories and new geographies. Changing global demographics, in particular, are unlocking new growth opportunities. Consider that Africa will account for more than half of global population growth in the coming decades, and that GDP for both China and India continues to climb in global rankings. Companies that successfully expand into new geographies are 22 percent more likely to achieve above-market, accretive growth.
Build scale and pursue personalization
Companies that wish to keep up must speed up—and scale up. The pandemic created a greater chasm between retail leaders and laggards: more than 90 percent of growth in retail market cap was driven by 25 large, tech-forward retailers. We expect further market consolidation, accelerated by the end of cheap capital.
But scale must not come at the expense of personalization. The bigger your company, the better you should get at localizing and personalizing your offerings. More than 70 percent of consumers expect personalization and are frustrated when companies don’t deliver it. Companies that excel at personalization generate 40 percent more revenue from those activities than average players.
Grow your core and expand your ecosystem
Historically, more than 80 percent of consumer companies’ growth has come from core offerings. Clearly, nurturing the core isn’t optional—and we’ve found, in fact, that many companies underestimate the core’s growth potential.
But as consumer behaviors diverge, companies must seek to become indispensable in consumers’ lives by expanding beyond products and into a range of services. Companies would do well to start pursuing “share of life,” not just share of wallet. Traditional sector barriers are falling; McKinsey research suggests that one-third of global GDP will soon come from ecosystems (which are networks or partnerships that cut across different industries). And consumers are receptive: for example, 60 percent of European consumers say they’re willing to buy services from retailers they trust. Companies can also tap into B2B opportunities—an excellent example being the rise of retail media networks, which generate a significant amount of incremental revenue and operating margins as well as generating valuable new consumer insights.

Consumers today live in a world of ands—they’re much more demanding and less willing to make trade-offs. Businesses, too, should live in a world of ands. If they take an uncompromising stance on the three aforementioned imperatives, the payoff will be above-average growth and healthy margins.Sajal KohliSenior Partner, ChicagoLinkedInEmailThe author wishes to thank Christina Adams, Kari Alldredge, Ali Bergmann, Dallas Cullen, Warren Teichner, Björn Timelin, and Anja Weissgerber for their contributions to this article.

The 4 Biggest Consumer Behavior Shifts of 2023 [According to New Data]

Your marketing strategy can't stay stagnant if the people you're selling to are changing their behavior — you have to adapt and learn how to cater to them. Marketers should look for observable differences in buyer behavior to continue meeting their needs.

To help marketers and other business professionals make more data-informed decisions, we've conducted a bi-annual survey of 600+ U.S. consumers to better understand how adults spend their money.
Using HubSpot Blog Research from our Consumer Trends Report, we'll explore the nature of the biggest consumer behavior changes between May 2022 and January 2023 so that you can keep up.

Biggest Consumer Behavior Shifts
1. Consumers are warming up to purchasing products through social media apps.
In May 2022, only 12% of consumers preferred purchasing products through social media apps like Instagram Shop or Facebook Marketplace. In the past three months, 41% of social media users have shared that they feel comfortable purchasing on social media platforms.
That behavior shift is astounding. More than ever, social media marketers are more likely to impact consumer behavior by sharing content that builds interest and trust through these channels.

HubSpot Blog Research also found that the most popular social media platforms, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, and TikTok, are the most preferred platforms for social shopping. Social shoppers also say Instagram and Facebook have the best in-app shopping experience.
These apps have very easy-to-use shopping interfaces, and it's plain to see why they can sell or influence users. When consumers watch or interact with the content they enjoy and receive ads relevant to their interests, the products seem more valuable to their hobbies and lifestyles.









































2. Gen X and Boomers are shopping through social media more, not just younger gens.
29% of Gen X (up 16% from May 2022) and 16% of Boomers (up 60%) say social media is their preferred product discovery channel. This shift is huge for generations that typically claim to prefer learning about products through TV ads and internet search.

Social media usage isn't just something teens use every day. Older generations use it just as often. Social networking provides entertainment, community, and a more dedicated space for window shopping.
3. Support for small businesses isn't dying down — it's growing.
42% of consumers have chosen a product based on it being made by a small business in the last three months, up 8% from May 2022.

The later effects of the pandemic may be behind this behavior shift. Many consumers saw some of their favorite mom-and-pop shops close due to lost funds from decreased traffic and customers. Now that the worst of COVID is over, many consumers haven't forgotten to support smaller businesses.
Another reason for supporting small businesses is the shopping experience itself. Many consumers enjoy shopping small due to:

Product diversity that chains don't offer
More hands-on and personable customer service
The positive feeling of giving back and building a community

4. Consumers are shopping more consciously, supporting businesses with corporate responsibility.
Along with support for the local community, consumers are giving more of their money to companies that take a political stand on issues they care about. These three causes are among the most important to them:

Racial justice
Climate change initiatives
LGBTQ+ rights 

Consumers want to support a company that pays it forward. They want to impact the world around them as they become more informed on news of global political unrest and other issues.
Businesses have much to gain from implementing socially responsible initiatives, programs, or donations to attract and retain customers. It may be the leading decision factor behind your next customer's purchase between you and your competitor.
Keep Up with Consumer Behavior Trends
One of the most significant risks a marketing team can make is failing to adapt to changing consumer behavior shifts. Stay informed on your customers' behaviors and ensure you meet their needs — even as they change.

How to Perform a Competitor Analysis (Examples & Templates)









 Written by: Masooma Memon


Jul 16, 2022 






Thorough competitor analysis is a crucial aspect of any marketing plan.
It helps you understand how challenging it could be to crack a market, what strategies could work, and how you can best position your brand.
It can also tell you what strategies won’t work, what the customer’s expectations are and how much they’re willing to pay.
Without it, you likely won’t survive a day in a new market.
You need to study your competition not only when you’re starting out but also periodically after cementing your feet in the market. This way, you can stay on top of your game, consistently growing your market share.
Not sure where to start?
We’ve got an easy, 6-step competitor analysis template for you in this guide. We’ll also share templates to help you document your findings.

What Is a Competitor Analysis?
Competitor analysis is the strategic research of your competitors to study their strengths and weaknesses.
By taking the time to analyze your current and potential competitors, you can identify areas for improvement. You want to look out for things like their value proposition, product, marketing and sales tactics.
 
The Benefits of Competitor Analysis for Businesses
Besides helping you find gaps in the market, studying your competition helps in the following ways:

Identify ways to outperform your competitors.
Understand market trends so you can make sure your business is consistently meeting and even exceeding industry standards.
Learn what your competitors are doing right. This is important for staying relevant in your market and growing your market share.
Find out how your product is different from other similar products. This helps you improve brand positioning and informs your marketing copy.

 
How To Conduct a Competitor Analysis (Step-by-Step)
A competitor analysis seeks to study all available information on your competitors, including their pricing, differentiators, positioning, product portfolio, strengths and weaknesses.
The steps below will help you uncover all this and more.
Step 1: Create a List of Your Competitors
Chances are you can recall who your competitors are in a breath.
But if you’re new, identifying who your direct and indirect competitors are will take some time.
Keep in mind that direct competitors offer products and services similar to yours, positioning them as a substitute for your business. They also mostly target the same audience.
On the flip side, indirect competitors are businesses that don’t necessarily offer the same product or service. However, their offering can solve the same customer problem that your business solves.
An easy, cost-effective way to identify competitors is by typing in your product type into the Google search bar.
Let’s suppose you have a project management software. A quick Google search on this will turn up names of companies offering the same type of software.

For creating a comprehensive list of competitors, make sure you google synonyms too. This could be a “project management tool” for the example above.
Another useful tactic is to conduct the same research on social media.
Type in what your business does and you’ll see similar business names pop up.

You can also surf hashtags to learn how other companies are using them.
Lastly, if you’re conducting market research interviews, pay attention to the brand names that target buyers mention in their interviews.

Step 2: Study Competitors’ Product Offerings and Market Share
Once you know who your competitors are, start studying them one by one.
Go through their product portfolio. Look at the products they offer, how they position and price them. Record your findings in a worksheet so you can track and analyze the data you’re gathering. Visme allows you to do this quickly and easily.
You can also grab a template from Visme’s template gallery and create a product and pricing sketch for each competitor. This will make it easy for you to visualize individual competitors.
To determine competitors’ market share, use Statista or a similar resource to get your hands on the numbers.
Track and visualize your findings in this template.

Step 3: Perform a SWOT Analysis
A Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats (SWOT) analysis helps you study what competitors are doing to win customers. You can also use it to identify gaps in your market.
For example, let's say a competitor’s customer support team takes pretty long to get back to customers. You can use the information to provide faster customer support and a better experience for customers.
As you hunt for competitors’ strengths and weaknesses, study the following areas:

Sales strategy
Brand positioning
Marketing plan
Discounts strategy
Website experience
Customer support and experience

Running an ecommerce business? Study competitors’ shipping and product return strategies as well.
An effective way to jump-start studying competitors’ strengths, weaknesses and more is through social listening. The goal? To identify what customers are saying about brands on social media channels they use, including chat forums and groups they are a part of.
A similar approach is to study customer reviews. This will help you understand what your competitors’ customers are saying about them.
Are they satisfied with the product quality? Or are they put off by their onboarding process? Do their support requests take long to get answered?
As you go about researching, record your findings in a SWOT analysis template like this one:





Customize this template and make it your own!

Edit and Download 


If you’re a Visme user, you have the benefit of coordinating your SWOT research efforts with your team.
If you and your business partner are working together on the research work, you can both access and edit the worksheet in Visme at the same time.
To do this, use the Share option from the top right side of your project dashboard in Visme. Select ""Share Privately"" and add your partner to the project.
From there, you two can collaborate on design, leaving comments for each other.

Step 4: Dig Deeper Into Competitors’ Pricing Strategy
We’ve already mentioned that you need to make notes on how your competitors price their products. But studying their pricing strategy goes deeper.
First, review what discounts competitors offer. Then look at how often they offer discounts.
Studying your competitors’ promo strategies will help you understand how they’re attracting customers and growing sales. It will also give you a good idea of how much the target market is willing to pay and what their expectations are in terms of discounts.
In addition to the manual research to uncover individual competitor pricing, use the same research tools mentioned above — social listening and customer reviews. They'll help identify what customers are saying. Pay attention to how customers respond to the discounts and promotions that competitors run.
Some businesses tend to offer discounts shortly after they launch new products. This can be a turn-off for shoppers who like to shop for the latest collections to stand out from their peers.
Similarly, other businesses extend product deals now and then despite telling customers it’s their last chance to buy.
See if and how that annoys customers and if there’s an opportunity for you to offer something more relevant and unique to the target market.

Step 5: Analyze Competitors’ Marketing Strategy
It’s important to study how competitors are raising brand awareness and moving leads down their marketing funnel.
Begin by identifying where your leading competitors are funneling their resources. Is it PPC they’re investing in? Or are they taking the community-building approach to attract, engage and nurture customers?
Chances are your competitors are big on educating customers, so they’re investing in content marketing.
Also, look at which channels competitors are focusing on. Is it Twitter or Reddit? Or do they have a strong presence on Instagram?
The answer to this will help you understand where your target audience is present and which marketing channels you should focus on.
Take Clearscope, an SEO content optimization tool, for example. They take an educational approach to their marketing by creating lots of webinar content.
Source
Ahrefs, another SEO tool, on the other hand, is also big on the educational approach. But they create blog content, not webinars.

Step 6: Document Your Research
In this last step, compile all your research in written format.
Create an action plan that includes a tactical list of steps to take. This way, you can discuss and prioritize steps to take with your team. Aim to be concise as you create this competitor analysis document.
If you create a wordy report, nobody will read it. But if you create a document that summarizes your findings and visualizes data in the form of charts and graphs, more people will read and appreciate your hard work.
Want some good news? Visme makes it uber-simple to create easy-to-read graphs and charts. It can help you create an easily shareable and visually engaging analysis document.
Design graphs using templates like the one below:

The ability to anticipate and adapt to emerging trends sets market leaders apart. As we approach 2024, the consumer world is pivoting at an unprecedented rate, influenced by technological advancements, global socio-economic shifts, and a collective reevaluation of values and priorities post-pandemic.
For brands, an in-depth understanding of these emerging trends is crucial. It’s no longer sufficient to react to changes as they occur; foresight and strategic planning are essential. 
Here, we delve into 15 pivotal consumer trends poised to redefine the market landscape in 2024. These trends are not just a passing wave; they are powerful currents reshaping industries ranging from Advertising and Agriculture to E-commerce, Technology, and Telecommunications. 
Embracing these trends means more than just staying relevant. It’s about seizing opportunities in a rapidly evolving marketplace, delivering value that resonates with modern consumers, and ultimately, shaping the future of your industry. 
Trend 1: Sustainable and Ethical Practices
The push for sustainable and ethical practices has moved from a niche concern to a mainstream demand in a world increasingly conscious of its ecological footprint and societal impact. This paradigm shift is not just a moral awakening but a response to the growing evidence of climate change and social inequality. A recent survey revealed that 73% of global consumers are willing to change their consumption habits to reduce environmental impact. This staggering statistic underscores the importance of this trend.
The emergence of this trend can be traced back to the growing awareness and accessibility of information regarding environmental and social issues. Social media and digital platforms have played a pivotal role in illuminating the consequences of unsustainable practices. The result is a more informed and conscientious consumer base, demanding transparency, sustainability, and ethical behavior from brands.
In the agriculture industry, this trend manifests as a surge in organic and regenerative farming practices. Consumers are increasingly seeking products that are healthy for them and beneficial for the planet. Consumer behavior is impacting food production. The Organic Trade Association noted a rise in organic food sales by 4% in 2022, reaching a record $60 billion in sales within the US that year, a clear indication of this growing demand. Moreover, adopting sustainable agriculture practices is not just a consumer preference but also a business imperative. According to the Business and Sustainable Development Commission, sustainable business models in the food and agriculture sector could open economic opportunities worth up to $2.3 trillion annually by 2030.
Consumer Packaged Goods (CPG) companies also feel this trend’s impact. There is a notable shift towards products with sustainable packaging, ethically sourced ingredients, and a transparent supply chain. A study by the Boston Consulting Group highlights that brands with a higher positive impact on society grow up to 4.5 times faster than those with a lower impact. This trend pushes CPG companies to rethink their product lifecycle, from sourcing to packaging and disposal.
The automotive industry is also undergoing a significant transformation, with sustainability taking center stage. Electric vehicles (EVs) are at the forefront of this change. Bloomberg forecasts that EVs will account for 10% of global passenger vehicle sales by 2025, up from just 3% in 2020. Consumer demand, regulatory pressures, and technological advancements drive this shift. Automotive giants are investing heavily in sustainable technologies, recognizing that the industry’s future is inextricably linked to environmental stewardship.
In conclusion, sustainable and ethical practices are no longer optional but critical to business strategy across various sectors. For industries like Agriculture, CPG, and Automotive, adapting to this trend is about meeting consumer demands and ensuring long-term viability in an increasingly conscientious global market. As brands navigate this shift, the ones that authentically embed sustainability and ethics into their core operations will likely emerge as leaders in the new consumer landscape of 2024 and beyond.
Trend 2: Personalization and Customization
The era of one-size-fits-all is fading into obscurity as we witness the rise of personalization and customization in consumer preferences. Today’s consumers seek products and services that cater to their tastes, needs, and preferences. This trend reflects a broader shift towards a more personalized consumer experience, emphasizing the individual rather than the mass market.
The root of this trend lies in technological advancements that have made data collection and analysis more sophisticated and accessible. With the advent of AI and machine learning, businesses can now gain deep insights into consumer behavior, preferences, and patterns. According to Salesforce, 66% of customers expect companies to understand their unique needs and expectations. This expectation has set a new standard in customer experience that is tailor-made and deeply personal.
In e-commerce, personalization has become a key differentiator. Amazon’s recommendation algorithm is a prime example, often cited as a significant driver of its sales, with 35% of purchases coming from product recommendations based on algorithms. This level of customization enhances the shopping experience, increases customer satisfaction, and boosts loyalty.
For B2B companies, personalization has evolved from a nice-to-have feature to a critical business strategy. A study by McKinsey & Company shows that 80% of B2B buyers now expect the same buying experience as B2C customers. This includes personalized communication, tailored solutions, and understanding their unique business challenges. B2B businesses that have embraced this trend are seeing substantial benefits, with 15% to 20% higher customer satisfaction rates and a 10% to 15% increase in sales conversion rates.
Personalization is taking on a more sophisticated form in the technology sector with the advent of customizable technology solutions. Companies now offer products tailored to specific user preferences, from customizable software interfaces to hardware that can be modified according to user needs. Apple’s iOS, for example, allows users to extensively tailor their phone’s functionality and interface, enhancing user experience and loyalty.
Personalization and customization are more than just marketing strategies; they represent a fundamental shift in how businesses interact with customers. They are about creating a unique value proposition for each customer, fostering a deeper connection and a more meaningful relationship. As we move into 2024, businesses across sectors like E-commerce, B2B, and Technology that harness the power of personalization and customization will stay relevant and thrive in an increasingly competitive marketplace.
Trend 3: Digital and Augmented Experiences
The lines between the physical and digital worlds continue to blur, giving rise to a new era of digital and augmented experiences. This trend, propelled by advancements in AR (Augmented Reality), VR (Virtual Reality), and AI (Artificial Intelligence), is reshaping the way consumers interact with the world around them. It’s a shift towards more immersive, interactive, and personalized experiences driven by a desire for enhanced engagement and convenience.
The growth of this trend can be attributed to significant technological advancements and increased accessibility to high-speed internet and smartphones. According to a report by PwC, the AR and VR market is expected to grow to $1.5 trillion by 2030, highlighting the enormous potential and interest in these technologies. This growth is also fueled by the increased consumer appetite for immersive experiences that go beyond traditional media consumption.
In the media industry, digital and augmented experiences are revolutionizing content consumption. Streaming services are experimenting with AR and VR to provide more engaging and immersive viewing experiences. For instance, Netflix’s interactive storytelling, like in “Black Mirror: Bandersnatch,” where viewers make decisions that influence the story’s outcome, represents the tip of the iceberg in this evolving landscape. The global video streaming market, estimated to reach $184.3 billion by 2027, increasingly incorporates these technologies to enhance viewer engagement and retention.


The telecommunications sector is also at the forefront of this trend. With the rollout of 5G technology, which offers faster speeds and lower latency, telecom companies are enabling more sophisticated and seamless AR and VR experiences. For example, Verizon’s venture into 5D technology promises to revolutionize how consumers and businesses interact with digital content, offering unprecedented levels of interactivity and immersion.
Advertising is another industry transforming digital and augmented experiences. Brands are leveraging AR and VR to create more engaging and interactive advertising campaigns. A report by eMarketer predicts that 58.9 million people will use VR and 93.3 million will use AR at least once per month in the US alone. This shift drives advertisers to develop innovative campaigns offering consumers a unique and memorable brand experience, increasing brand engagement and loyalty.
The trend of digital and augmented experiences clearly indicates the direction in which consumer preferences are heading. As we advance into 2024, industries like Media, Telecommunications, and Advertising must adopt these technologies and innovate continuously to stay ahead in a rapidly evolving digital landscape. Those who succeed in creating immersive, engaging, and personalized experiences will capture the hearts and minds of consumers in this new digital era.
Trend 4: Health and Wellness
The surge in consumer consciousness around health and wellness marks a pivotal shift in lifestyle choices and purchasing behavior. This trend, fueled by a growing awareness of the importance of physical and mental well-being, significantly influences various industry sectors. In an era where health is increasingly viewed holistically, consumers seek products and services that contribute positively to their overall well-being.
This trend’s roots can be traced to a combination of factors, including increased access to health-related information, a rise in chronic health conditions, and a growing emphasis on preventive healthcare. A study by the Global Wellness Institute reveals that the global wellness economy is valued at $4.5 trillion, indicating the vast scale and impact of this trend.
In the Food and Beverage industry, this shift towards health and wellness is evident in the rising demand for nutritious, organic, and natural products. Consumers are now more inclined towards food and drinks that satisfy hunger and offer health benefits. According to a Nielsen report, sales of products with health attributes rose by 4% globally, outpacing total store sales. This demand is reshaping the industry, with companies increasingly focusing on clean labels, transparency, and health-centric product innovations.
The Animal Health sector is also experiencing a parallel shift. Pet owners increasingly treat their pets as family members and are equally conscious about their health and well-being. The global pet food market, expected to reach $128.4 billion by 2025, reflects this trend. There’s a growing demand for premium, organic, and specially formulated pet foods and products that cater to pets’ overall health, including dietary supplements and health-focused pet care products. 
We recently conducted a study in the UK to explore how brands can support Vets in the current economic climate by understanding their challenges and relationship with pet owners. Read about our findings here. 
In CPG, the health and wellness trend is prompting a reevaluation of product portfolios. Companies are reformulating products to reduce artificial ingredients, sugars, and unhealthy fats. They are also introducing new product lines that align with wellness trends, such as plant-based alternatives and functional foods. The global functional food market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 7.7% between 2020 and 2025, showcasing the sector’s response to this health-conscious wave.
The health and wellness trend is not just a passing fad but a fundamental shift in consumer priorities. As we move into 2024, the Food and Beverage, Animal Health, and Consumer Packaged Goods sectors are poised to see continued growth and innovation in this space. Companies that can effectively tap into this trend and offer products that genuinely contribute to the consumer’s overall well-being will be well-positioned to thrive in the coming years.
Trend 5: Convenience and Speed
In an age where time is a precious commodity, the demand for convenience and speed has escalated to new heights, becoming a key determinant in consumer decision-making. This trend, driven by a fast-paced lifestyle and the digital revolution, is reshaping consumer expectations and industry practices across various sectors.
The essence of this trend lies in the consumers’ desire for immediate gratification and efficiency in every aspect of their lives. A report by McKinsey & Company highlights that convenience is one of the top factors customers consider when choosing where to shop, with 60% of global consumers citing it as a key factor.
In e-commerce, convenience and speed are revolutionizing shopping experiences. The proliferation of one-day or even same-day delivery services exemplifies this trend. Amazon, for instance, has set a high bar with its Prime service, offering fast and reliable delivery. This has led to a competitive landscape where speed is a significant differentiator. 
According to Statista, the global e-commerce market is expected to reach $4.99 trillion by 2028, with a large part of this growth attributable to enhanced convenience and faster delivery times.
The Food and Beverage industry is also significantly impacted by this trend. The rise of meal delivery services, quick-serve restaurants, and on-the-go food options are responses to the growing consumer demand for convenience. A study by the National Restaurant Association found that 78% of consumers say they order takeout or delivery at least once a month, citing convenience as a primary reason. 
Furthermore, there’s an increasing trend in pre-prepared meal kits and ready-to-eat meals, catering to time-pressed consumers seeking both quality and convenience.
Financial Services have not been left untouched by this trend. The industry has seen a surge in digital transformation, aiming to provide faster, more convenient services. Mobile banking, contactless payments, and digital wallets are innovations catering to the need for speed and ease. According to a survey by Business Insider Intelligence, 89% of survey respondents reported using mobile banking for convenience. The industry is also witnessing the rise of fintech companies that leverage technology to offer quicker and more user-friendly financial solutions.
The trend towards convenience and speed clearly indicates the evolving consumer landscape. As we approach 2024, industries like E-commerce, Food and Beverage, and Financial Services must continuously innovate and streamline their operations to meet these changing consumer demands. Brands that can effectively offer time-saving solutions without compromising quality will gain a competitive edge in attracting and retaining customers in this fast-paced world.
Trend 6: Value-Driven Consumption
The rise of value-driven consumption marks a significant shift in consumer behavior, emphasizing the importance of values and ethics in purchasing decisions. This trend reflects a growing consumer preference for brands and products that align with their personal beliefs and values, such as sustainability, social responsibility, and ethical practices.
At the heart of this trend is an increasing awareness and concern for various global issues, including environmental sustainability, social justice, and ethical business practices. A report by Nielsen indicates that 73% of global consumers say they would change their consumption habits to reduce their environmental impact.
In the automotive industry, value-driven consumption is manifesting primarily in the increasing popularity of electric vehicles (EVs) and sustainable automotive technologies. Consumers actively seek out environmentally friendly transportation options driven by carbon emissions and climate change concerns. The International Energy Agency (IEA) reports that the global electric car market is set to grow significantly, with a projection of 125 million EVs on the road by 2030. This shift pushes traditional automotive manufacturers to invest heavily in electric and hybrid technologies, redefining the industry’s future.
CPG brands also feel this trend’s impact. There is a growing demand for ethically sourced, environmentally friendly, and socially responsible products. This has led to increased eco-friendly packaging, fair-trade certifications, and transparency in supply chain practices. CPG companies are now more than ever focusing on building brand loyalty through value alignment rather than just price and quality.
The agriculture sector is experiencing a parallel shift towards sustainable and ethical practices. Consumers are increasingly aware of their food choices’ environmental and social impact. This awareness is driving demand for organic, locally sourced, and sustainably farmed produce. A report by the Organic Trade Association shows that organic produce sales in the US alone reached $22 billion in 2023, up 4% from the previous year. The trend is pushing the agriculture industry towards more sustainable farming methods and transparent supply chains.
Value-driven consumption is reshaping the marketplace, with consumers increasingly making choices based on a brand’s values and ethical practices. As we move into 2024, industries like Automotive, Consumer Packaged Goods, and Agriculture must adapt to these evolving consumer preferences. Companies that prioritize and communicate their commitment to ethical and sustainable practices will likely see a growing base of loyal customers who align with their values.
Trend 7: Social Media Influence
The burgeoning impact of social media influence on consumer behavior and industry practices has been undeniable. This trend has grown exponentially in recent years, transforming how brands interact with consumers, particularly in sectors like Advertising, Media, and markets targeting Kids and Youth.
The ascendancy of social media as a dominant force in shaping public opinion and consumer habits is underpinned by its vast reach and engagement levels. As of 2023, there are 4.62 billion social media users worldwide, which equates to 58.4% of the global population. This widespread adoption has made social media a powerful tool for influencing consumer decisions.
In the advertising sector, social media platforms have evolved into crucial channels for reaching and engaging audiences. Influencer marketing, a strategy that leverages individuals with significant social media followings to promote products, has become particularly effective. A survey by Mediakix revealed that 89% of marketers find ROI from influencer marketing comparable to or better than other marketing channels. Brands are increasingly allocating substantial portions of their marketing budgets to social media campaigns, seeking to capitalize on the authenticity and relatability that influencers can provide.
The media industry has also been revolutionised by social media influence. Traditional forms of media consumption are being overshadowed by content consumption through social platforms. The Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism reports that more than half of the global population now uses social media to access news, making it a critical platform for media companies to engage with their audience.
Furthermore, the impact of social media on Kids and Youth is particularly significant. This demographic, often called ‘digital natives,’ is highly influenced by social media trends and influencers. A study by the Pew Research Center found that 95% of teens in the United States have access to a smartphone, and 45% say they are online ‘almost constantly’. The implications for industries targeting this age group are profound, necessitating a strong and authentic social media presence to capture this market segment effectively.
With its far-reaching implications, the trend of social media influence is reshaping how brands approach marketing and consumer engagement. As we approach 2024, it is evident that industries like Advertising, Media, and those targeting Kids and Youth will continue to evolve with social media at the forefront, adapting strategies to leverage its powerful influence. Brands that can effectively harness the potential of social media stand to gain a significant competitive advantage in connecting with and influencing their target audiences.
Trend 8: Home-Centric Products and Services
The shift towards home-centric products and services has been a defining trend, especially in the wake of global events that have reshaped our living and working habits. This trend, gaining momentum, significantly influences industries such as technology, telecommunications, and e-commerce.
The rise of remote work and the increasing desire for comfort and convenience at home have catalyzed the demand for home-centric products and services. According to a survey by Global Workplace Analytics, 76% of global employees want to continue working from home at least part-time, post-pandemic. This shift has led to a surge in demand for home office equipment, smart home devices, and home entertainment systems.
In the tech sector, this trend is evident in the increased investment in smart home technology. A report by Statista predicts that revenue in the Smart Home market is projected to reach USD 232 billion in 2028. Products like smart speakers, home security systems, and connected appliances are becoming commonplace, reflecting a growing consumer preference for technology that enhances home living.
The telecommunications industry is also adapting to this home-centric shift. With more people working and entertaining themselves from home, there’s a heightened demand for robust and reliable home internet services. A study by Ericsson forecasts that global mobile data traffic will grow fourfold between 2021 and 2026, primarily driven by increased online activities at home. Telecommunications companies are thus focusing on expanding their broadband infrastructure and offering more competitive home internet packages.
E-commerce has seen a significant uptick in this era of home-centricity. Online shopping, already on the rise, has been further accelerated by the pandemic. The convenience of having products delivered directly to homes has appealed to a broader consumer base. According to a report by eMarketer, global e-commerce sales are expected to surpass $5 trillion in 2024 for the first time, accounting for over a fifth of total retail sales.
This trend towards home-centric products and services reshapes consumer priorities and drives innovation across multiple industries. As we look towards 2024, the Technology, Telecommunications, and E-commerce sectors, in particular, are poised to continue evolving in response to this trend. Companies that can effectively cater to consumers’ home-based needs and preferences will likely see sustained growth and success in the coming years.
Trend 9: E-commerce Innovation
E-commerce, a sector already at the forefront of digital transformation, is continuing to innovate at a rapid pace. These advancements significantly impact various industries, including B2B, CPG, and financial services, redefining how businesses and consumers interact in the digital marketplace.
One of the major innovations in e-commerce is integrating artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). These technologies are enhancing the customer experience through personalized recommendations, predictive search functionalities, and customer service chatbots. According to a report by Salesforce, 84% of customers say the experience a company provides is as important as its products and services, underscoring the value of these innovations. In the B2B sector, AI-driven platforms are streamlining the procurement process, offering more efficient and personalized purchasing experiences.
Another significant e-commerce innovation is augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR). These technologies allow consumers to visualize products in a real-world context before purchasing, greatly enhancing the online shopping experience. This is particularly transformative for the CPG industry. A study by Gartner predicts that by 2024, 25% of people will spend at least one hour per day in the metaverse for work, shopping, education, social, and entertainment.
Payment technology is also undergoing rapid evolution in e-commerce. The emergence of blockchain and cryptocurrency, along with more established digital wallets and payment platforms, is creating a more diverse and secure financial ecosystem. This profoundly impacts Financial Services, where traditional banking is increasingly intersecting with fintech innovations. Estimates reveal that the transaction value of digital wallet payments will exceed $10 trillion by 2025.
Lastly, sustainability is becoming a key focus in e-commerce innovation. Consumers are increasingly aware of environmental impact, leading to a rise in sustainable packaging and eco-friendly shipping options. The CPG industry, in particular, is responding to this shift, with 73% of global consumers saying they would definitely or probably change their consumption habits to reduce their environmental impact.
As we approach 2024, e-commerce innovation continues to shape the landscape of B2B transactions, redefine consumer experiences in the CPG sector, and challenge traditional financial services models. The businesses that embrace these innovations and adapt to the evolving digital marketplace will be well-positioned to thrive in this dynamic environment.
Trend 10: Inclusivity and Diversity
The increasing focus on inclusivity and diversity represents a profound shift in consumer expectations and corporate practices, particularly influencing the advertising, media, and brands that appeal to kids and youth. This trend is not just about social responsibility; it’s about reflecting the diverse world we live in and acknowledging consumers’ varied experiences and identities.
In advertising, the drive towards inclusivity and diversity is evident. A study by Adobe found that 61% of Americans find diversity in advertising important, and 38% of consumers are more likely to trust brands that do well with showing diversity in their ads. This shift pushes advertisers to create campaigns that represent a broader spectrum of humanity, moving away from stereotypical portrayals towards more authentic and diverse representations.
The media industry is also undergoing a significant transformation in this regard. According to the Nielsen Inclusion Analytics report, there’s a growing demand for content that represents diverse voices and stories. Films and shows with diverse casts are achieving higher box office numbers and viewer ratings. For example, series with at least 40% diverse casts enjoy higher ratings than those with less diversity.
For kids and youth brands, inclusivity in media and advertising is particularly impactful. The Common Sense Media report highlights that children’s programming with diverse characters and storylines can promote empathy and understanding among young viewers. In 2024 and beyond, content creators and educators are focusing more on inclusive content that reflects a variety of backgrounds, abilities, and experiences, helping to shape a more accepting and diverse future generation.
These trends underscore a broader societal shift towards valuing diversity and inclusion. Companies in the advertising, media, and kids and youth sectors that embrace this trend are aligning with ethical standards and resonating more deeply with their audiences. As we look to 2024, inclusivity and diversity will continue to be critical factors in building brand loyalty, audience engagement, and societal impact.
Trend 11: Smart Technologies
The proliferation of smart technologies is a trend reshaping multiple sectors, notably automotive, technology, and telecommunications. These technologies, characterized by their ability to connect, share, and interact with users and other devices, create a more integrated and intelligent world.
In the auto industry, smart technologies are revolutionizing the driving experience. According to a report by MarketsandMarkets, the global connected car market is projected to reach $166 billion by 2025, growing at a CAGR of 25.2% from 2020. This growth is fueled by advancements in IoT (Internet of Things) and AI, enabling features like autonomous driving, predictive maintenance, and personalized in-car experiences. For instance, Tesla’s Autopilot and Full Self-Driving features represent significant milestones in smart automotive technology.
The tech sector is witnessing an explosion of smart devices and applications. The increasing ubiquity of IoT devices is a key aspect of this trend. According to Statista, the number of IoT-connected devices worldwide is expected to reach 75.44 billion by 2025. These devices are enhancing convenience and efficiency in homes and workplaces and gathering massive amounts of data, which can be leveraged for insights and innovations.
Telecommunications is another sector deeply impacted by smart technologies. 5G technology, which offers faster speeds, lower latency, and the ability to connect more devices simultaneously, is a cornerstone of this trend. Ericsson predicts there will be 3.5 billion 5G subscriptions globally by 2026. This advancement is not just about faster smartphones; it’s enabling a wide array of applications from smart cities to remote healthcare, and driving the evolution of IoT and AI technologies.
The integration of AI with IoT, known as AIoT, is set to be a transformative force. It combines IoT’s data collection and interaction capabilities with the advanced data analysis and decision-making skills of A.I. Forecasts say over 80% of enterprise IoT projects will incorporate AI, up from only 10% in 2019.
Smart technologies are not just futuristic concepts but are rapidly becoming integral to our daily lives. Their influence on various sectors is profound, paving the way for a more connected, efficient, and intelligent future. As we move into 2024 and beyond, these technologies’ potential applications and impacts will continue to expand, making them a crucial trend for businesses and consumers alike.


Trend 12: Shift in Work Culture
The evolving landscape of work culture, characterized by increasing flexibility, remote work, and a focus on employee well-being, is a significant trend impacting industries across the board, particularly B2B, telecommunications, and tech sectors. This shift is reshaping how businesses operate, employees work, and workspaces are designed.
In the B2B sector, the change in work culture is evident in the increasing demand for products and services that support remote and flexible work environments. A report by Global Workplace Analytics estimates that 25-30% of the workforce will be working from home multiple days a week by the end of 2023. This shift necessitates B2B companies to adapt their offerings, such as cloud-based solutions, collaboration tools, and virtual communication platforms, to meet the evolving needs of businesses.
Telecommunications plays a pivotal role in this trend. The industry is at the forefront of enabling remote work through advanced connectivity solutions. As per PwC, 78% of CEOs agree that remote collaboration is here to stay for the long term. This has spurred growth in demand for high-speed internet, 5G networks, and secure communication technologies, which are essential for seamless remote working.
The tech sector is both a driver and a beneficiary of the changing work culture. Tech companies are leading by example in adopting flexible work policies. This transition is supported by a suite of technologies, including cloud computing, AI-driven analytics, and cybersecurity solutions. The tech industry is also innovating to create tools that facilitate virtual collaboration, project management, and employee engagement in a distributed workforce.
Moreover, there’s a growing emphasis on employee well-being and work-life balance, further influencing workplace dynamics. According to the LinkedIn Global Talent Trends report, 96% of talent professionals stated that employee well-being has gained importance in their organization. This leads to more holistic work policies and practices prioritizing mental health, flexibility, and employee satisfaction.
The shift in work culture is more than just a reaction to the pandemic; it’s a fundamental change in the paradigm of work. Adapting to and capitalizing on this trend is crucial for all sectors and industries. As we look towards 2024 and beyond, the evolution of work culture will continue to shape business strategies, technological advancements, and the way we think about work and productivity.
Trend 13: Privacy and Data Security
The importance of privacy and data security cannot be overstated. This trend, critical for sectors like financial services, e-commerce, and tech, shapes consumer behavior and influences corporate policies.
For the financial services sector, data security is paramount. With the proliferation of online transactions, consumers are becoming more concerned about the safety of their financial information. According to a survey by Deloitte, 73% of consumers ranked data privacy as important when choosing a financial institution. This has led to significant investments in cybersecurity measures by banks and financial institutions. For instance, global spending on information security and risk management technology and services is estimated to reach $150.4 billion by the end of 2023.
In e-commerce, privacy and data security are equally critical. Online retailers handle vast amounts of customer data, making them attractive targets for cyberattacks. A study by IBM found that the average cost of a data breach in the retail sector was $2.01 million in 2023. This has prompted e-commerce companies to adopt more robust data protection protocols, like enhanced encryption and secure payment gateways, to safeguard customer information and maintain trust.
The technology sector is at the forefront of addressing privacy and data security concerns. As technology advances, so do the complexities of data protection. Tech companies continuously innovate to provide solutions that ensure data integrity and confidentiality. The rise of privacy-focused technologies like blockchain and advanced encryption methods are testaments to this trend. 
Consumer awareness around data privacy is also rising. This has led to a demand for more transparency and control over personal information, prompting companies across these sectors to adopt privacy-by-design principles in their operations.
Looking ahead to 2024 and beyond, privacy and data security will continue to be critical. As digitalization deepens, brands must stay ahead of evolving cybersecurity threats and continuously build consumer trust through robust data protection practices. This trend is not just a regulatory requirement; it’s a strategic imperative in a world where data is the new currency.
Trend 14: Experience over Ownership
The shift towards valuing experiences over ownership marks a significant change in consumer behavior. This trend reflects a deeper desire for meaningful and memorable engagements rather than material possessions.
In the auto sector, the rise of car-sharing and subscription services exemplifies this trend. Consumers are increasingly opting for access to a vehicle rather than owning one. This shift is driven by urbanization, environmental concerns, and a growing preference for access over ownership, especially among younger consumers.
The food and beverage industry is also witnessing this transformation. Consumers are seeking unique dining experiences that offer more than just food. According to a study by Eventbrite, 75% of millennials would rather spend money on a desirable experience or event over buying something desirable. This has led to a surge in experiential dining concepts, food festivals, and culinary tourism. Restaurants and food brands are innovating to provide immersive experiences, from themed dining to interactive culinary workshops.
In the media sector, the focus has shifted from owning physical media to accessing a wide range of content through streaming services. The global video streaming market was valued at $146.6 billion and is expected to grow 8.86 percent through 2028. This growth is fueled by consumers’ desire for diverse, on-demand content that provides an experience.
This trend towards experience over ownership is driven by various factors, including the rise of the digital economy, environmental awareness, and changing lifestyle preferences. As consumers seek richer experiences and connections, industries must adapt by creating offerings that are not just products or services but memorable experiences that resonate on a deeper emotional level.
In 2024 and beyond, the experience economy will continue to thrive. Automotive companies will innovate with flexible usage models, food and beverage businesses will craft unique experiential offerings, and media companies will enhance content delivery to provide immersive experiences. This trend signifies a profound shift in consumer values, emphasizing the importance of experiences in shaping our lives and choices.
Trend 15: Localism
Localism, the increasing preference for locally sourced and produced goods, is a trend that has seen significant growth and is particularly influential in the agriculture, food and beverage, and CPG industries. This shift reflects a broader consumer awareness and preference for sustainability, community support, and product traceability.
In the agriculture sector, the demand for local produce has surged. According to a survey by the National Farmers Union, 68% of consumers prefer to buy produce that has been grown locally. This trend is driven by a desire for fresh, high-quality products and a growing concern about the environmental impact of long-distance food transportation. Farmers’ markets and community-supported agriculture (CSA) programs have become increasingly popular, providing direct channels for consumers to access local produce.
The food and beverage industry has also witnessed a significant impact. A report by the Food Marketing Institute showed that 55% of consumers are willing to pay more for products sourced from their local area. Restaurants and food retailers are increasingly highlighting local ingredients in their offerings, catering to the growing consumer interest in the origin of their food. This localism trend has led to the rise of farm-to-table restaurants and local craft breweries, emphasizing the connection between the consumer, their food, and the local community.
There is a notable shift towards local brands and products in the Consumer Packaged Goods sector. A study revealed that local brands are growing faster than global ones, with a 50% increase in consumer preference for local over global products. Consumers seek products with local ingredients, production, and heritage, viewing them as more authentic and trustworthy.
Localism as a trend is driven by a combination of factors: a desire for transparency in product sourcing, support for local economies, environmental concerns, and a search for authenticity. In 2024 and beyond, this trend will continue to shape consumer choices and strategies. Businesses aligning with this trend by sourcing locally, highlighting local heritage, and fostering community connections will likely see increased consumer loyalty and preference. Localism reflects a consumer trend and embodies a broader societal shift towards sustainability and community-focused living.
Final Thoughts
As we have explored in this comprehensive analysis, the 15 consumer trends highlighted are not mere fleeting phenomena but represent significant shifts in the consumer landscape. These trends, from sustainable practices to digital experiences and localism, underscore a dynamic and evolving marketplace. 
Understanding and adapting to these trends is crucial for brands aiming to remain relevant and successful in the ever-changing business environment.
The key takeaway for brands is the importance of agility and responsiveness. In a world where consumer preferences and behaviors continuously evolve, brands must quickly adapt, innovating and reevaluating their strategies to align with these trends. Whether embracing sustainable practices, personalizing offerings, or engaging with smart technologies, each trend presents unique opportunities for brands to connect with their audience meaningfully.
Another critical aspect is the need for authenticity and transparency in all brand actions. As consumers become more informed and concerned about issues like sustainability, data privacy, and ethical practices, brands that demonstrate genuine commitment and transparency in these areas will likely gain consumer trust and loyalty.
Furthermore, integrating technology and digital strategies is no longer optional but a necessity. Technology plays a pivotal role in addressing and capitalizing on these trends, from enhancing customer experiences through augmented realities to leveraging data for personalized marketing.
In conclusion, the 15 consumer trends of 2024 present a roadmap for brands to navigate the future market landscape. By embracing these trends, brands can stay ahead of the curve and forge deeper, more meaningful connections with their consumers. The future belongs to those who are prepared to innovate, adapt, and resonate with their audience’s evolving needs and values.

In many ways, 2020 marked a change in how digitalization impacted both individuals and businesses. Consumers have adjusted the way they live and work, and delivering on those consumer preferences has become the new business battleground. In fact, 70% of consumers believe that a business is only as good as its customer service, with 67% of customers willing to pay more for brands that offer better service.

Although some changes have merely accelerated the adoption of habits already emerging — such as a preference for personalization and digital-first interactions — other changes spell out a lot more introspection from brands. During my conversations with leaders from some of the world’s most influential brands, I uncovered three key trends that are forever reshaping customer expectations.


Digital Is Here To Stay

Today, customer journeys often begin with a digital experience, and they’re not limited to one specific channel. Since the pandemic began, digital interactions have replaced in-person experiences, so it’s not surprising to learn that live chat and chatbots are the fastest-growing channels globally. Although picking up the phone and calling customer service remains the most frequently used way to interact with brands, more than 40% of consumers now use live webchat, making it the second most popular channel. With this shift in consumer behavior, it’s no coincidence that digital-first customer service solutions have emerged as their own software category with customers flocking to digital channels.
What does that mean for your company? It means that investing in digital is no longer a nice-to-have, and offering self-service digital channels is a must. For example, financial institutions used to rely on clients visiting branch locations to have that personal connection with their financial consultants. That wasn’t possible for a while with Covid-19, so as a result, we’ve seen a dramatic uptick in digital channel usage.

One executive from a Fortune 500 financial institution told me that the company shifted its entire online CX strategy to let customers self-serve in a way that eliminated waiting time, but the customers never felt like the bank didn’t remember them or their history. Company leaders also noticed customers were increasingly tweeting questions about financial planning challenges, but it was hard to provide personalized help on such a public channel. The company deployed an omnichannel strategy that allowed for conversations to start anywhere, but then brought customers into a more comfortable, context-rich channel where they could have a realistic and candid conversation about their financial health.

The key to making this work in the real world is experience orchestration. With empowered agents that have visibility into the full customer journey — including historical transactions, previous customer service exchanges, preferred contact channels and movement from one channel to another — companies can deliver a truly connected experience while leveraging the power of digital.


Real-Time, Event-Driven Communication Is Expected
As we move into another phase of the pandemic with increasing in-person interactions and movement, it’s more critical than ever to unify and improve the customer experience across both physical and digital channels. A current example is curbside pickup — a shift in consumer behavior that’s predicted to likely outlast the pandemic. Popularized by big retailers like Walmart and Target, curbside pickup has since expanded beyond the grocery space, with nonessential retailers like Best Buy and Nordstrom offering the service as an option as consumer uptake continues.
Completing and coordinating successful curbside pickups require clear communication throughout the buying process. The key to making this work for your brand is a next-gen CX architecture that can easily allow data and context to be shared across business units and functions — from the warehouse to the POS, to a mobile app, to customer support and beyond.
Delivering successful omnichannel experiences is only possible when systems are connected across sales, marketing and service. As consumers continue to rely on digital for many transactions and services that can’t yet happen in person, maintaining a streamlined customer experience across all channels will play a pivotal role in purchasing decisions today and building long-term loyalty in the future.
Values Matter More Than Ever
The last year brought about a renewed sense of awareness of social causes amid the unique circumstances of the pandemic, environmental and social crises. Consumers around the world are adjusting their shopping habits in a quest to support businesses that are socially responsible.
Accessibility is a cornerstone of great customer experiences and great brands but is often overlooked as part of a sustainability program. Companies like Genesys partner Be My Eyes use video to allow blind and low-vision people to have someone else “see” for them to overcome access barriers. In addition to providing an enriching experience, this also makes good business sense. In fact, when it comes to the visually impaired, two-thirds of e-commerce transactions are abandoned due to a lack of accessibility.
Other companies getting it right include mindfulness app Headspace, which responded to the Covid-19 crisis by giving away free subscriptions to health care and unemployed workers. Also, Genesys client Airbnb recently announced that they will be housing 20,000 Afghan refugees globally for free.
For many, the post-Covid-19 world is an opportunity to rebuild for the better. Consumers are seeking more purpose-driven services and products. Companies that utilize the right technologies to communicate with customers at the right time and explore ways to use products and services for good may find themselves best positioned for the next normal.

Canoo's technology gives us a blank canvas to reimagine how the EV fits into our changing auto ecosystem.  We have focused on a use case approach to generate the largest possible total addressable market ('TAM') based off a common platform, our MPP1,"" said Tony Aquila, Canoo's Executive Chairman. ""We are building vehicles that are not burdened by legacy constraints and developing technologies and functional designs to build EVs for everyone.

Non-GAAP financial measures
This press release includes certain adjusted financial measures (namely, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA) that are non-GAAP financial measures (""NGFMs"") as defined under Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC"") rules.  Canoo believes these NGFMs provide useful information to investors as a supplement to its consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (""GAAP"").
The presentation of these NGFMs is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. These measures may be different from NGFMs used by other companies, because all companies may not calculate NGFMs in the same fashion. In addition, these NGFMs are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. NGFMs have limitations in that they do not reflect all the amounts associated with our results of operations as do the corresponding GAAP measures.
A reconciliation of the NGFMs measures included in this press release to the most comparable GAAP measure can be found in the tables included at the end of this press release.
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA
""EBITDA"" is defined as net loss before interest expense, income tax expense or benefit, and depreciation and amortization. ""Adjusted EBITDA"" is defined as EBITDA adjusted for share-based compensation, restructuring charges, asset impairments, and other costs associated with exit and disposal activities, acquisition and related costs, changes to the fair value of contingent earnout shares liability, and any other one-time non-recurring transaction amounts impacting the statement of operations during the year. Adjusted EBITDA is intended as a supplemental measure of performance that is neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. Canoo believes Adjusted EBITDA, when combined with net loss, and EBITDA, is beneficial to an investor's complete understanding of its operating performance.  Canoo believes that the use of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating its performance, ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial measures with those of comparable companies, which may present similar NGFMs to investors. However, you should be aware that when evaluating EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, Canoo may incur future expenses similar to those excluded when calculating these measures. In addition, Canoo's presentation of these measures should not be construed as an inference that its future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Canoo's computation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures computed by other companies, because all companies may not calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in the same fashion.
Because of these limitations, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Canoo compensates for these limitations by relying primarily on its GAAP results and using EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA on a supplemental basis. You should review the reconciliation of net loss to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA below and not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate Canoo's business.
Forward-Looking Statements
The information in this press release includes ""forward-looking statements"" within the meaning of the ""safe harbor"" provisions of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of words such as ""estimate,"" ""plan,"" ""project,"" ""forecast,"" ""intend,"" ""will,"" ""expect,"" ""anticipate,"" ""believe,"" ""seek,"" ""target"" or other similar expressions that predict or indicate future events or trends or that are not statements of historical matters. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding estimates and forecasts of financial and performance metrics, projections of market opportunity and market share, expectations and timing related to commercial product launches, potential success of, and ability to accelerate its, go-to-market strategy, and Canoo's ability to capitalize on commercial opportunities. These statements are based on various assumptions, whether or not identified in this press release, and on the current expectations of Canoo's management and are not predictions of actual performance. These forward-looking statements are provided for illustrative purposes only and are not intended to serve as, and must not be relied on by any investor as, a guarantee, an assurance, a prediction or a definitive statement of fact or probability. Actual events and circumstances are difficult or impossible to predict and will differ from assumptions. Many actual events and circumstances are beyond Canoo's control. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including changes in domestic and foreign business, market, financial, political and legal conditions; failure to realize the anticipated benefits of the business combination with Hennessy Capital Acquisition Corp. IV; the rollout of Canoo's business and the timing of expected business milestones and commercial launch; future market adoption of Canoo's offerings; risks related to Canoo's go-to-market strategy; the effects of competition on Canoo's future business; the ability to issue equity or equity-linked securities, and those factors discussed  under the captions ""Risk Factors"" and ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations""  in Canoo's registration statement on Form S-1 filed on January 13, 2021, and the definitive proxy statement/prospectus contained therein, and the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 to be filed with the SEC on or before March 31, 2021, as well as its other filings with the SEC, copies of which may be obtained by visiting Canoo's Investors Relations website at investors.canoo.com or the SEC's website at www.sec.gov. If any of these risks materialize or Canoo's assumptions prove incorrect, actual results could differ materially from the results implied by these forward-looking statements. There may be additional risks that Canoo does not presently know or that Canoo currently believes are immaterial that could also cause actual results to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements. In addition, forward-looking statements reflect Canoo's expectations, plans or forecasts of future events and views as of the date of this press release. Canoo anticipates that subsequent events and developments will cause Canoo's assessments to change. However, while Canoo may elect to update these forward-looking statements at some point in the future, Canoo specifically disclaims any obligation to do so unless required by law. These forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as representing Canoo's assessments as of any date subsequent to the date of this press release. Accordingly, undue reliance should not be placed upon the forward-looking statements.

Skip to main contentThe great consumer shift: Ten charts that show how US shopping behavior is changingAugust 4, 2020 | Article Tamara Charm Becca Coggins Kelsey Robinson Jamie WilkieOur research indicates what consumers will continue to value as the coronavirus crisis evolves. (13 pages)
Anyone who has hosted a game night over video chat or ordered groceries to be delivered at home for the first time understands how profoundly the COVID-19 crisis has changed our behavior as consumers. But which of these changes will stick? We see several that are key:

Flight to online
Shock to loyalty
Need for hygiene transparency
Back to basics and value
Rise of the homebody economy

We’ve boiled down extensive McKinsey consumer research into ten exhibits to illustrate the trends and the consumer segments associated with each.
Flight to online
1. Digital shopping is here to stay
Physical distancing and stay-at-home orders have forced whole consumer segments to shop differently. A few months into COVID-19, consumer shopping online has increased significantly across many categories. Consumer intent to shop online continues to increase, especially in essentials and home-entertainment categories. More interestingly, these habits seem like they’re going to stick as US consumers report an intent to shop online even after the COVID-19 crisis. Categories where expected growth in online shoppers exceeds 35 percent include essentials such as over-the-counter (OTC) medicine, groceries, household supplies, and personal-care products. Even discretionary categories such as skin care and makeup, apparel, and jewelry and accessories show expected customer growth of more than 15 percent.

2. Millennials and high-income earners are in the lead when it comes to shopping online
While the shift to online shopping has been near universal across categories, high-income earners and millennials are leading the way in shifting spend online across both essential and nonessential items. Gen X has experienced a similar online shift, although not at the same scale as millennials. Gen Z has concentrated its shift online in particular categories: apparel and footwear, at-home entertainment, and food takeout/delivery.

Shock to loyalty
3. Consumers are switching brands at unprecedented rates
The crisis has prompted a surge of new activities, with an astonishing 75 percent of US consumers trying a new shopping behavior in response to economic pressures, store closings, and changing priorities. This general change in behavior has also been reflected in a shattering of brand loyalties, with 36 percent of consumers trying a new product brand and 25 percent incorporating a new private-label brand. Of consumers who have tried different brands, 73 percent intend to continue to incorporate the new brands into their routine. Gen Z and high earners are most prone to switching brands.
The beneficiaries of this shift include big, trusted brands, which are seeing 50 percent growth during the crisis, and private labels, which have outpaced the retail market. Some 80 percent of customers who started using a private brand during the pandemic indicate they intend to continue using it once the COVID-19 crisis subsides.

4. Brands need to ensure strong availability and also convey value
Shoppers have cited a number of reasons for switching brands, with availability (in-store and online), convenience, and value leading the pack.
For marketers, this highlights the need to quickly become aware of when shoppers are migrating brands or retailers and then to manage the logistics to ensure product and service availability. Looking at China, which is further along in its recovery cycle than most countries, the increase in promotional activity to cater to consumers’ focus on value in apparel is expected to continue.

Need for hygiene transparency
5. US consumers are changing how they shop in response to health and safety concerns
As Americans contemplate going back out to shop, hygiene and hygiene transparency have emerged as important sources of concern. It is becoming increasingly important for stores and restaurants to not only follow hygiene protocols (thorough cleaning and masks for consumers and employees are top priorities) but also communicate effectively that they are following those procedures.
US consumers have already started to change their behavior in response to hygiene concerns. Technologies that enhance hygiene, particularly contactless activities such as food and grocery delivery and curbside pickup, are taking off. There is strong intent to continue contactless activities across the United States. As an example, 79 percent of consumers intend to continue or increase their usage of self-checkout in retail after COVID-19. Millennials and Gen Z are the widest adopters of contactless activities.
 5
Back to basics and value
6. Consumer shopping intent is focused on essentials
Around 40 percent of US consumers have reduced spending in general, and they expect to continue to cut back on nonessentials specifically. This reality reflects profound discomfort about the state of the economy.
With overall consumer spending declining, intent to spend in essential categories is increasing. Even among those with higher incomes, we see that while essentials show spending momentum, intent to buy discretionary products still lags significantly. As the worst of the crisis abates, we do see online spending in nonessential categories such as apparel and footwear starting to come back. This effect is strongest among high-income earners, consumers in the Northeast, and Gen Z.
 6
7. Consumers want value for their money—especially in essential categories
Tied to the concern about the state of the economy is an increasing consumer focus on value—especially for essential categories. For example, in shampoo on Amazon, value and mass products have experienced the greatest increase in share, at two- and five-percentage-points gains, respectively. Premium shampoo products have seen significantly less growth in comparison, losing more than five points of volume.

Rise of the homebody economy
8. Americans are changing how they spend their time at home
Americans are spending more of their at-home time on domestic activities, media, and news. Intent to eat more at home post-COVID-19 has strengthened significantly over the past three months. Usage of popular online entertainment platforms has skyrocketed. (The popular video game Fortnite recently hosted a concert that was “attended” by 12.3 million users.1Andrew Webster, “More than 12 million people attended Travis Scott’s Fortnite concert,” The Verge, April 23, 2020, theverge.com.) Investment in at-home fitness through equipment purchases and online activity is growing. Consumers still expect to spend more time on at-home activities, even in less-restricted regions.
 8
9. Americans are concerned about going back to regular activities outside the home
As economies reopen, 73 percent of consumers are still hesitant to resume regular activities outside the home. They are concerned about going to a hair salon, gym, or restaurant, but are especially worried about shared environments, such as public transportation, ride sharing, air travel, and being in crowded spaces, such as attending large indoor or outdoor events.

Behaviors vary by consumer segment
10. ‘Great consumer shift’ trends vary by consumer segment
US consumer-segment behavior varies significantly across the next-normal trends. We have identified five customer segments driven by optimism, health, and financial concerns, each of relatively similar size. These five segments exhibit the consumer trends to a different degree and have the following characteristics:
Affluent and unaffected: These consumers express general optimism about the future (~20 percent higher than the overall US consumer population), skew male (60 percent), and make more than $100,000 a year. They tend to be able to stay at home during the pandemic crisis, allowing them to shop more online. This group is slightly less price sensitive than other cohorts due to greater job stability.
Uprooted and underemployed: These consumers are feeling major impact on both their finances and health due to job insecurity. They are cautious about how they spend money, with low optimism about future economic conditions. Not surprisingly, this group is trading down to essentials and value, swapping out brands, and shopping online when possible.
Financially secure but anxious: This population is largely 65 years old and older and is generally pessimistic about economic conditions after COVID-19, which has had a major impact on their habits. This group has expressed the greatest need for hygiene transparency, with above-average concerns on safety and well-being and concerns about the ability to get necessary supplies.
Out trying to make ends meet: These consumers are being cautious about how they spend money and feel that their jobs and job security have been heavily impacted by COVID-19. This group has significant representation from minority groups and rural populations. They are less likely to be able to stay at home (hence their lower likelihood to be part of the homebody economy), but they are strongly moving toward shopping for essentials and value.
Disconnected and retired: This category denotes those who are retired, over 65, and have a lower income level than the financially-secure-but-anxious segment. They are broadly optimistic about economic conditions after COVID-19 and are less likely to display any of the next-normal characteristics. Predominantly from Southern and suburban areas of the country, this group has not exhibited significant changes in shopping behavior.
 10

As retailers contemplate the changes in consumer behavior, they will need to adjust their strategies and execution to adapt to the new norms, including:

Adjusting mix and spend to where the consumer is now (go digital, ensure full coverage of bottom-funnel marketing and demand capture, think region-by-region)
Revamping messaging and creative to be in sync with the times, particularly in terms of hygiene and value
Ensuring the end-to-end journey meets the new hygiene and at-home needs
Managing corporate social-responsibility efforts to build brand strength authentically
Refocusing on online and pickup solutions and rebuilding real-time measurement plans, as traditional media-mix models won’t suffice

Further, it will be important for brands to reevaluate and reprioritize their target audience and consumer segments, as the emphasis on each of the next-normal trends will vary based on the target consumer.Tamara Charm is a senior expert in McKinsey’s Boston office, where Jamie Wilkie is a partner; Becca Coggins is a senior partner in the Chicago office; and Kelsey Robinson is a partner in the San Francisco office.

There's no question about it: consumer behavior is changing faster than ever before.
Specifically, what consumers want, where they want it, and when they want to access their products and services are constantly in flux.
In this report, we're going to cover 9 of the most important consumer behavior trends in 2024 (and beyond).
1. Consumers Expect Multiple Payment Options
As people increasingly shop online, they also expect a wide selection of different payment options from online retailers.
This includes offering different ways to pay (like accepting credit, debit, and PayPal payments).
But also the ability to defer payments over time. 
In fact, the ""Buy Now, Pay Later"" (BNPL) industry is growing alongside the general growth in eCommerce as a whole.
Searches for ""BNPL"" have grown by 843% over the last 5 years. 
And there's no shortage of fintech startups cropping up to meet the demand for BNPL at checkout.
Afterpay (known as Clearpay in the UK) is one of the leaders in this category.
But there are several others, like Sezzle, making serious inroads.
Searches for ""Sezzle"" have grown by 200% over the last 5 years.
2. Shoppers Want Everything Delivered
Over the last few years, we've seen a surge in products delivered to the home.
Including products that were traditionally only bought in-store, including:

Eyeglasses (Warby Parker)
Workout equipment (Peloton)
Groceries (Instacart)
Shoes (Allbirds)

The best example of this trend might be the DTC mattress category.
Brands like Nectar Mattress have seen rapid growth largely by delivering a product that was previously seen as too large and bulky to deliver to people's homes.
Then the pandemic happened.
Searches for ""Nectar Mattress"" over the last 5 years. 
And suddenly, consumers expected everything delivered to their doorstep.
The plant delivery space is a great example of the ""everything delivered"" trend.
Searches for ""plant delivery"" spiked at the start of the pandemic. 
Plants are difficult to ship.
But, like essentially all products, consumers now want them delivered anyway.
And a handful of companies that have pounced on this demand (like Bloom & Wild), have seen rapid growth.
3. Increased Demand for Ethical and Sustainable Products
According to research by IBM, 77% of consumers consider sustainability and environmental responsibility to be at least ""moderately important"" brand values.

Consumers support environmentally responsible products.
Harvard Business School report that sustainable products have 5.6x higher average sales growth compared to those that aren't marketed as sustainable.
So there's no question that sustainable products from ethical companies is one of the biggest consumer behavior trends to keep an eye on over the next 3-4 years.
An example of a growing sustainable product category is bamboo toilet paper.

Searches for ""bamboo toilet paper"" spiked during COVID. But is still seeing growth (113% in 5 years).
Unlike traditional toilet paper, bamboo toilet paper is sourced from a plant with a relatively small negative environmental impact: bamboo.
(This category's growth is also due to the fact that companies started to offer at-home bamboo toilet paper delivery.)
Consumers not only want products that are sustainable.
They also want to buy from brands that act ethically. 
In fact, a recent survey found that 32% of US and UK consumers would pay more for the same product if that product came from an ethical brand.
4. People Take Care of Their Health At Home
Telemedicine usage surged during the pandemic.
Some estimates say that the number of telemedicine appointments increased by 5,000% during the height of the pandemic.
However, doctor visits are just one of many areas of health and wellness that have shifted largely to the home.
Another growing at-home health trend is at-home spa treatments. 
Even though many spas have reopened (albeit with restrictions), we're seeing continued demand for spa treatments that can be done at home.
For example, Dermaplaning.
Searches for ""Dermaplaning"" have increased by 2,400% over the last 10 years.
Dermaplaning is a skincare treatment usually done at a spa or a dermatologist's office.
But consumers are now using at-home kits to take this skincare routine into their homes.
We're also seeing consumers replace their gym with at-home versions.
Searches for ""garage gym"" spiked during lockdowns.
Global Google search growth for ""garage gyms"".
Even with gyms now open, interest in at-home gyms hasn't completely died down.
That leads us to our next consumer behavior trend.
5. Influencers Increasingly Influence Buying Decisions
Millennials and Gen Z consumers continue to rely on influencers for product discovery.
And for choosing which brands to trust.
In fact, according to Influencer Marketing Hub, the influencer marketing market has increased year-over-year, reaching an estimated $13.8 billion in 2021.
This is why influencer marketing is still a growing marketing channel.
And one that many marketers rely on.
However, the way consumers interact with and buy from influencers is changing.
Specifically, consumers now seek out recommendations from social media influencers that may only have a small, niche audience.
An industry study by HypeAuditor found that social accounts between 1k-5k followers get 2x more relative engagement on each post than influencers with a larger following.
This is why we're seeing an increasing number of brands seek out ""micro influencers"".
Searches for ""micro influencers"", who are influencers with <50k followers on a given platform, have increased by 7,800% over 10 years.
A recent report found that 40% of brands that use influencer marketing have decided to partner with a micro influencer over a traditional influencer.
6. Consumers Subscribe to More Monthly Services
The monthly subscription industry has grown rapidly with subscribers increasing by 90% year-over-year.
This growth is largely due to the fact that consumers are more open to subscribing to monthly products and services than ever before. 
And, from Amazon Prime to video streaming services, there's now a wide array of monthly subscription products to choose from.
For example, video games have historically been one-off purchases.
You see a game that you want. Buy it at a one-time price. And play the game for an unlimited amount of time.
This is still largely the case.
But we're also seeing Sony, Microsoft, and other gaming industry giants roll out subscription gaming services. 
Which are essentially the Netflix for video games.
For example, Sony's PS Now service streams hundreds of titles for a monthly subscription fee. And it quickly grew to 3.2 million+ subscribers.
Searches for ""PS Now"" had been rising over the last 5 years before a recent dip. 
Other examples of this consumer trend include monthly boxes, streaming services, and meditation apps.
7. Consumers Spend More on Their Pets
The US pet furniture market size alone is worth over $2 billion.
And pet owners are now more willing than ever to shell out big bucks to increase their pets’ quality of life.
The pet market is growing steadily.
And a growing piece of the industry is based on luxury products.
For example, CBD for dogs, organic cat food, and devices for owners to video-call their pets.
Search growth for ""CBD for dogs"" is up 1,400% in 10 years.
No matter the product: if it will make their pets happier, there’s likely going to be a group of owners who will buy it.
A few more examples:
If Fido has too much ice cream (or too many Starbucks Puppuccinos) you can buy him a dog treadmill.
Or help him get back in balance with some raw dog food or dog supplements.
Searches for “dog supplements” have been rising each year.
If Fido still isn’t back in shape after that, it may be time to buy some pet insurance.
But why are people spending so much on their pets now?
Like many consumer behavior trends over the past year, the answer is: probably the pandemic.
Owners are more willing to buy luxury pet products having recently seen their pets more often.
The trend has been growing for longer than that, though.
As a long-term movement, luxury pet products are most likely related to the fact that fewer people are having children. (And opting for “fur babies” instead.)
Which is a larger trend that’s expected to continue worldwide.
8. The Mindfulness Market Continues to Grow
The global meditation market is expected to grow from $4.08 billion in 2019 to $9 billion in 2027 (at a 10.4% CAGR).
Growth of the meditation market into 2027.
Calm is an app that offers short, themed meditations for increasing concentration or tackling difficult emotions.
And outside of its regular meditations, Calm features the voices of celebrities like LeBron James and Matthew McConaughey.
Calm has a free basic plan as well as a premium membership for $69.99 per year.
To date, the company has raised $218 million in VC funding.
One of Calm’s biggest competitors is Headspace, founded in London in 2010 but now headquartered in California.
Headspace gets new users started with a 10-day introductory course to guided meditation. It also features “mindfulness workouts” and physical stretching exercises.
Headspace’s pricing is similar to Calm’s, with a $69.99 annual subscription as well as a $12.99 monthly option.
The company has raised $215.9 million to date, including $100.7 million in equity and $40 million in debt in 2020.
Waking Up is another example. The guided meditation app features Sam Harris, author of the NYT bestselling book of the same name.
Its price is higher than Calm and Headspace, at $99.99 per year.
Searches for “Waking Up app” are up 1,225% in 10 years.
The Ten Percent Happier meditation app is also based on a bestselling book. It offers a free version as well as a $99/year membership.
Ten Percent Happier has raised $8.1 million to date.
Google searches for ""Ten Percent Happier"" are up 600% in 5 years.
Inner Explorer has designed a mindfulness system and app for teachers.
The non-profit’s daily exercises are currently used by over 5,000 schools and reach more than 1.7 million students.
Which they say has led to 28% higher student grades and a 43% decrease in teacher-reported stress.
Other popular meditation apps include Insight Timer (for which searches have increased 85% in five years) and Breethe (for which searches are up 30%).
Biofeedback startups are taking a different approach to the mindfulness space.
Biofeedback consists of monitoring your body’s reactions (like heartbeat, breathing, and brain activity) so that you can try to control your stress, emotions, motivation, or ability to focus.
Research shows that biofeedback may even help treat conditions like migraines and high blood pressure.
One interesting biofeedback startup is Muse.
Muse makes EEG headbands designed to help users meditate and sleep better. Combined with its companion app, the device plays the sound of peaceful weather as you focus on your breathing. When your mind wanders, the noises turn stormy to remind you to relax.
The startup has raised $39.9 million since it was founded in 2007.
The Muse 2 EEG headband.
EMOTIV makes similar EEG headbands but is designed to monitor stress and help users focus.
Dreem’s headbands are made to aid sleep.
And MindLabs raised a $1.4 million pre-seed round to launch its “Peloton for mental health”. Which will consist of EEG headbands, guided meditations, and live video courses.
While Halo Neuroscience works in the opposite direction. Rather than simply measuring brain activity, the company’s “Halo Sport” device generates an electrical current to stimulate the wearer’s brain.
According to the company, its technology can improve performance in activities like learning guitar, endurance cycling, and playing piano.

Growing low-tech mindfulness practice is personal journaling.
Journaling is said to help people manage anxiety, focus on priorities, reduce distractions, and identify opportunities for growth.
And it’s been recommended by famous personalities like Oprah Winfrey and Tim Ferriss.
That may be why search interest in journaling is up over 5 years:
Searches for ""journaling"" are up 133% in 10 years.
Journaling habits range from free-form writing to trademarked practices like “Morning Pages” and the Bullet Journal, to other structured forms like gratitude journaling.
Searches for “gratitude journal” have increased by 138% in 5 years.
Here are a few players in the journaling space:
Jour is a guided journaling app that’s used by over 800k people. The startup raised a $1.8 million seed round.
Intelligent Change has sold over 1 million copies of its structured physical journals, “The Five Minute Journal” and “Productivity Planner”. It also sells app versions of them.
And Glimpses is a Windows-based journaling tool that syncs with Dropbox.
9. The Home Becomes The Hub
The average North American adult spends 90% of their time indoors.
And with more people working from home than ever before, this number may be on the rise.
And all of this time spent living and working at home is already starting to shift consumer behavior in unexpected ways.
For example, the rise of the smart doorbell.
Searches for ""smart doorbells"" have increased by 96% over the last 5 years.
As people spend more time at home, they realize that their home security may not be up to par, that they want to see their entire home exterior in real-time, and that their online shopping deliveries are at risk on the front steps.
This is why we're seeing increased demand for smart doorbell products, like Amazon's Ring.
Another example of this trend is the increasing number of searches related to cooking.
For example, searches for the product ""air fryer"" have increased over the last five years.
Searches for ""air fryers"" have increased by 426% over the last half-decade.
Conclusion
Many of these consumer behavior trends were already here before the coronavirus struck. But the COVID pandemic put many of these trends into overdrive.
That said, we can expect many of these trends to be sustained long-term.
One thing that ties many of these trends together is a focus on convenience. Consumers are increasingly willing to invest in products and services that save them time and effort. Even if they have to pay a premium to do it.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA
""EBITDA"" is defined as net loss before interest expense, income tax expense or benefit, and depreciation and amortization. ""Adjusted EBITDA"" is defined as EBITDA adjusted for stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, asset impairments, and other costs associated with exit and disposal activities, acquisition and related costs, changes to the fair value of contingent earnout shares liability, and any other one-time non-recurring transaction amounts impacting the statement of operations during the year. Adjusted EBITDA is intended as a supplemental measure of our performance that is neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. We believe Adjusted EBITDA, when combined with net loss, and EBITDA, is beneficial to an investor's complete understanding of our operating performance. We believe that the use of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial measures with those of comparable companies, which may present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. However, you should be aware that when evaluating EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA we may incur future expenses similar to those excluded when calculating these measures. In addition, our presentation of these measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Our computation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures computed by other companies, because all companies may not calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in the same fashion.
Because of these limitations, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. We manage our business utilizing EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as supplemental performance measures.

It can be big and bold, in the manner that only a 100-inch 8K tv set can be, or sleek and portable, like the latest generation of phones, watches, and media players.

So here’s an overview of a few of the ways that Apple, Samsung, Sony, and the other market leaders will be looking to part us from our hard-earned cash in 2022.

Rise of the Domestic Robots 


Robots in the home have been on the cards for a while, and robotic vacuum cleaners and other single-purpose devices are already relatively common. But with Astra, Amazon is bringing what it believes will be the first general-purpose home robot to the market. If it’s a success, other manufacturers are sure to follow, in the same way, they did when Amazon introduced home AI assistants with the Echo.
Astra can act as a roving security bot, keeping an eye out for people who shouldn’t be there, as well as an ""Alexa on wheels,"" coming to find you when you have calls or alerts. It also has a personality so it can keep you company or just provide general entertainment. Other robots that are either hitting the market or appearing as prototypes will offer help with household chores, healthcare monitoring for the elderly who live alone, or serve an educational purpose.

Smarter Things
The first generation of ""smart"" products were really just ""connected products,"" from smartphones that let us browse the web to TVs that let us watch Youtube and Netflix. Machine learning came later, and as well as enabling phones to prolong their battery life with intelligent power management, or take better pictures with image enhancing algorithms, brought us smart thermostats that learn how to operate efficiently and devices that are essentially capable of operating autonomously, like self-driving cars. Today, rather than simply letting us watch online content and run apps, smart TVs use AI to adapt their picture and sound to the environment they are in, and have built-in natural language recognition algorithms so we can control them with our voices. Smart consumer devices in 2022 will build on this ability to deliver personalized solutions to the unique challenges we face in our day-to-day lives, whether it’s the angle that the sun shines on our TV screen or monitoring our activity to provide fitness advice.

VR/AR and the Internet of Senses
Engage with digital content and services online traditionally involves stimulation of two of our senses – sight and hearing. Moving forward, both manufacturers and content providers will look to engage us through touch, taste, and smell to create truly immersive consumer experiences. Much of this will take place in virtual reality environments (VR), where new devices will let us smell and feel experiences, meaning that they will seem increasingly “real” and interactive. Videogame Phasmophobia involves hunting ghosts, with the terrifying innovation that players can feel themselves being touched or grabbed by ghouls and apparitions, if they are wearing a haptic suit. Both VR and augmented reality (AR) consumer devices will proliferate during 2022 – Oculus is reported to have sold close to two million of its Quest 2 headsets during 2021, meaning more content producers will be motivated to bring their games and experiences to VR. We can also expect competitors like HTC and Sony to step up their play for their share of the lucrative new market. We can also expect consumer entertainment, including movies and gaming, to provide more realistic audio experiences – Nvidia is applying the “ray tracing” principles it uses to create ultra-realistic computer images to sound creation, to create richer and more realistic soundscapes.


Enter the Metaverse
A new Matrix movie will drive consumer interest in virtual worlds and alternate digital realities, and consumer technology will be there to offer a taste in 2022. Companies including Facebook, Nvidia, and Microsoft have laid out their plans for the metaverse, with their aim of creating immersive online environments that offer a persistent world for work, socializing, and play. However, game developer Epic could have played the biggest part in showing us the way forward, with its Fortnite game attracting up to 15 million players online at any one time, to build things, experience live concerts, and, of course, blow each other up.  
5G and other ultrafast networks
5G capabilities will become the norm for mobile phones and other devices at all price points, rather than being confined to premium and flagship products. This will mean higher definition and higher bandwidth video services will start to become available, including 8K streaming as well as cloud gaming and VR. This means that devices will become smaller and lighter as there’s no need for bulky processors and graphics chips, with all the calculations being done remotely and the output simply streamed to consumer devices as a video feed.
Smart homes and the internet of things
The trend for all things domestic to become increasingly “smart” and capable of communicating and connecting with each other in more useful ways will continue throughout the next year. In fact, analysts at Gartner have predicted that the average home could contain more than 500 smart devices during 2022. This year should finally see the launch of Matter, the “smart home OS” created in collaboration by Apple, Google, and Amazon, which aims to create a standard operating environment for connected devices in the home. Currently, devices from different manufacturers generally operate using their own protocols, and although these are frequently designed to play nicely with others, there’s no equivalent of Windows or MacOS to let consumers manage and connect all of their gadgets and toys. This could change in 2022, when it’s predicted the market for smart home devices will grow to $53 billion.
NFT, blockchain, and digital twins
I’m putting these all together in one category because when it comes to their applications in consumer technology, they are closely related. Put simply, blockchains (persistent, distributed, and encrypted digital ledgers), NFTs (unique tokens that can be created and stored on blockchains), and digital twins (digital models or replicas of real-world products or processes) will change the way we interact with technology. In 2022 we will start to see them impacting consumer products in a big way. Consumer brands including Sony, Asics, and Coca-Cola have signaled their intention to be a part of the NFT space, and we can expect to see digital goods and services designed to complement and augment physical consumer products. This is a result of brands increasingly seeing growing their digital engagement to be equally important to their business strategy as simply selling us products.

The push for the use of electric vehicles in the U.S. is ramping up. Especially in California as the state just put a ban on gas-burning cars by 2035. Tony Aquila, the CEO of Canoo, a public EV company, is certain he can compete with brands like Tesla. But there’s one hurdle—Canoo hasn’t yet generated any revenue. 
Walmart signed an agreement with Canoo in July to purchase 4,500 all-electric delivery vehicles, beginning with the Lifestyle Delivery Vehicle, with the option to purchase up to 10,000 units. But the company is “hanging on by a thread,” writes my colleague Jessica Mathews.
“Inside the chaos at Canoo, the zero-revenue, cash-burning EV company that just inked a major deal with Walmart,” is Mathews’ new report that gives the scoop on the inner workings of the Bentonville, Arkansas-based startup.
Canoo said in its Q2 2022 earnings report the company has “over $1 billion” in its sales pipeline. But it reported a net loss of $164.4 million, up from $112.6 million in Q2 of last year. 
On the Aug. 8 earnings call, Ramesh Murthy, interim CFO and chief accounting officer, talked about the “road to profitability.” Murthy said: “It’s becoming more clear to everyone that our philosophy on cash and access to capital is in line with what a technology-driven company would do. We are milestone and event focused on how we access capital on our road to profitability. By focusing on milestones and key events, we can drive sustainable value to the company and all our stakeholders.”
Mathews interviewed Aquila in June and rode in one of Canoo’s futuristic electric campervans. 
“Canoo’s vehicles were still going through test programs and not yet on the market,” she writes. “Production wouldn’t begin until at least the end of 2022, and the company hadn’t started construction on its own manufacturing facilities. (The van we were sitting in was a prototype.)”
She continues, “Canoo had just recently signed an agreement with hedge fund Yorkville Advisors to sell up to $250 million worth of its shares at a discount to their already depressed market price. The Securities and Exchange Commission was investigating the company over its 2020 SPAC merger, and the company was tied up in three legal spats, including two class action lawsuits from retail investors in its shares. Indeed, right there in an SEC filing from March 31, Canoo itself had said it might not make it another year.” 
“And yet, Aquila—the tattooed, 57-year-old private-equity executive who had begun taking control of the company in 2020—looked me right in the eye when I asked about whether Canoo had the funding it needed for the next year. ‘I am a just-in-time capital guy,’ he assured me.” Mathews also discovered that Walmart’s purchase of yet-to-be-produced EVs is not the first financial boost that Aquila has received from the Walmart family in his career.  
Automakers are now required to steadily increase their sales of zero-emission cars in California, the nation’s largest auto market. And because 17 other states typically follow California’s auto-emissions standards, last week’s vote by the California Air Resources Board could reach far beyond the state, requiring the auto industry to speed up its switch to electric cars, Fortune reported. 
As the electric vehicle market continues to evolve, “Canoo is hardly the only EV startup to take investors and employees on a wild ride over the past couple of years,” Mathews writes. “Concern over climate change has lured an unprecedented amount of investor capital into the space, but the logistical challenges of launching an automaker from scratch haven’t gotten any less daunting.”
But, “Crack open the hood even an inch, however, and it’s clear that, even with the Walmart deal, Canoo is floundering to an extreme degree,” Mathews writes. (You can read the complete article here.)

Sheryl Estradasheryl.estrada@fortune.comBig dealDeloitte’s Q3 CFO Signals survey released today found that, overall, nearly half (46%) of CFOs expect the North American economy to be in recession by the new year. But it also varies by industry. For example, 67% of CFOs in the energy/resources industry expect a recession in North America by 2023, compared to 52% of CFOs in manufacturing, 50% in technology, 48% in financial services, and 25% in health care. CFOs are pursuing recession-proofing measures such as reducing operating expenses, controlling headcount, and reprioritizing capital expenditure. However, CFOs’ concerns over inflation vastly outweighed recession concerns. CFOs have lower expectations for year-over-year revenue growth— 6.2% this quarter, down from 7.8% in Q2 2022. Meanwhile, earnings growth expectations are at 6.4%, a decline from 8.4% in the prior quarter. The findings of Deloitte's quarterly CFO survey are based on a survey of 112 CFOs (74% from public companies and 26% from privately held firms). Respondents are from the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, and the vast majority are from companies with more than $1 billion in annual revenue.Going deeper""Gen X is cutting back on everything because of inflation—except retirement savings,"" a Fortune report by Alicia Adamczyk, is an analysis of State Street Global Advisors’s recent Inflation Impact Survey. As Gen X gets closer to retirement, they’re “significantly” more concerned about rising prices than millennials or Baby Boomers. LeaderboardDave McKinstray was named CFO at North America Cereal Co., the upcoming spinoff of Kellogg Company (NYSE: K). As announced in June 2022, Kellogg Company plans to separate three of its businesses—Global Snacking Co., North America Cereal Co., and Plant Co. McKinstray held several CFO roles throughout his nearly 15 years at Kellogg, such as CFO of the U.S. Snacks business and as CFO of U.S. Retail Sales before moving into his current role as VP of integrated business planning. His roles before Kellogg included positions in commodity risk management and trading.Christoph Pachler was named CFO at FaZe Holdings Inc. (Nasdaq: FAZE) a lifestyle and media platform focused on gaming and youth culture, effective on or before October 3. Pachler has more than 25 years of financial management experience. Pachler joins FaZe Clan from Critical Content, an independent television studio in Los Angeles, where he served as managing director and CFO. Before Critical Content, Pachler was the EVP and CFO for Playboy Enterprises, a media and brand licensing company. Pachler previously spent 13 years in various expanding roles at Sony Pictures Entertainment, where he was lastly the CFO and SVP for strategy and operations in Sony's international TV business.Overheard""Inflation numbers can miss the mark on properly reflecting a country’s economic mood because these figures offer an incomplete picture of a country’s economic health. Consumer sentiment, on the other hand, reflects our attitudes about the current state of the economy and expectations about its trajectory. And by all accounts, consumer sentiment is at record lows–and its decline has been more protracted than during past dips.""—Christos A. Makridis, a professor, entrepreneur, and adviser who serves as an adjunct fellow at the Manhattan Institute, explained in a Fortune opinion piece that research shows consumer sentiment matters more than inflation and unemployment numbers. This is the web version of CFO Daily, a newsletter on the trends and individuals shaping corporate finance.

In this guide, we’ll outline how to do a competitive analysis and explain how you can use this marketing strategy to improve your business.Whether you’re running a business or playing in a football game, understanding your competition is crucial for success. While you may not be scoring touchdowns in the office, your goal is to score business deals with clients or win customers with your products. The method of preparation for athletes and business owners is similar—once you understand your strengths and weaknesses versus your competitors’, you can level up. In this guide, we’ll outline the steps for a competitive analysis and explain how you can use this marketing strategy to improve your business. With our free competitor analysis template, you can identify who you’re up against and create a more insightful business plan.What is a competitive analysis?Competitive analysis involves identifying your direct and indirect competitors using research to reveal their strengths and weaknesses in relation to your own. Direct competitors market the same product to the same audience as you, while indirect competitors market the same product to a different audience. After identifying your competitors, you can use the information you gather to see where you stand in the market landscape. Create a competitive analysis templateWhat to include in a competitive analysisThe purpose of this type of analysis is to get a competitive advantage in the market and improve your business strategy. Without a competitive analysis, it’s difficult to know what others are doing to win clients or customers in your target market. A competitive analysis report may include:A description of your company’s target marketDetails about your product or service versus the competitors’Current and projected market share, sales, and revenuesPricing comparisonMarketing and social media strategy analysisDifferences in customer ratingsYou’ll compare each detail of your product or service versus the competition to assess strategy efficacy. By comparing success metrics across companies, you can make data-driven decisions.Read: What is a key performance indicator (KPI)?How to do a competitive analysisFollow these five steps to create your competitive analysis report and get a broad view of where you fit in the market. This process can help you analyze a handful of competitors at one time and better approach your target customers.1. Create a competitor overviewIn step one, select between five and 10 competitors to compare against your company. The competitors you choose should have similar product or service offerings and a similar business model to you. You should also choose a mix of both direct and indirect competitors so you can see how new markets might affect your company. Choosing both startup and seasoned competitors will further diversify your analysis.Tip: To find competitors in your industry, use Google or Amazon to search for your product or service. The top results that emerge are likely your competitors. If you’re a startup or you serve a niche market, you may need to dive deeper into the rankings to find your direct competitors.2. Conduct market researchOnce you know the competitors you want to analyze, you’ll begin in-depth market research. This will be a mixture of primary and secondary research. Primary research comes directly from customers or the product itself, while secondary research is information that’s already compiled. Then, keep track of the data you collect in a user research template.Primary market research may include: Purchasing competitors’ products or servicesInterviewing customersConducting online surveys of customers Holding in-person focus groupsSecondary market research may include:Examining competitors’ websitesAssessing the current economic situationIdentifying technological developments Reading company recordsTip: Search engine analysis tools like Ahrefs and SEMrush can help you examine competitors’ websites and obtain crucial SEO information such as the keywords they’re targeting, the number of backlinks they have, and the overall health of their website. 3. Compare product featuresThe next step in your analysis involves a comparison of your product to your competitors’ products. This comparison should break down the products feature by feature. While every product has its own unique features, most products will likely include:PriceService offeredAge of audience servedNumber of featuresStyle and designEase of useType and number of warrantiesCustomer support offeredProduct qualityTip: If your features table gets too long, abbreviate this step by listing the features you believe are of most importance to your analysis. Important features may include cost, product benefits, and ease of use.4. Compare product marketingThe next step in your analysis will look similar to the one before, except you’ll compare the marketing efforts of your competitors instead of the product features. Unlike the product features matrix you created, you’ll need to go deeper to unveil each company’s marketing plan. Areas you’ll want to analyze include:Social mediaWebsite copyPaid adsPress releasesProduct copyAs you analyze the above, ask questions to dig deeper into each company’s marketing strategies. The questions you should ask will vary by industry, but may include:What story are they trying to tell?What value do they bring to their customers?What’s their company mission?What’s their brand voice?Tip: You can identify your competitors’ target demographic in this step by referencing their customer base, either from their website or from testimonials. This information can help you build customer personas. When you can picture who your competitor actively targets, you can better understand their marketing tactics. 5. Use a SWOT analysisCompetitive intelligence will make up a significant part of your competitor analysis framework, but once you’ve gathered your information, you can turn the focus back to your company. A SWOT analysis helps you identify your company’s strengths and weaknesses. It also helps turn weaknesses into opportunities and assess threats you face based on your competition.During a SWOT analysis, ask yourself:What do we do well?What could we improve?Are there market gaps in our services?What new market trends are on the horizon?Tip: Your research from the previous steps in the competitive analysis will help you answer these questions and fill in your SWOT analysis. You can visually present your findings in a SWOT matrix, which is a four-box chart divided by category.6. Identify your place in the market landscapeThe last step in your competitive analysis is to understand where you stand in the market landscape. To do this, you’ll create a graph with an X and Y axis. The two axes should represent the most important factors for being competitive in your market. For example, the X-axis may represent customer satisfaction, while the Y-axis may represent presence in the market. You’ll then plot each competitor on the graph according to their (x,y) coordinates. You’ll also plot your company on this chart, which will give you an idea of where you stand in relation to your competitors. This graph is included for informational purposes and does not represent Asana’s market landscape or any specific industry’s market landscape. Tip: In this example, you’ll see three companies that have a greater market presence and greater customer satisfaction than yours, while two companies have a similar market presence but higher customer satisfaction. This data should jumpstart the problem-solving process because you now know which competitors are the biggest threats and you can see where you fall short. Competitive analysis exampleImagine you work at a marketing startup that provides SEO for dentists, which is a niche industry and only has a few competitors. You decide to conduct a market analysis for your business. To do so, you would:Step 1: Use Google to compile a list of your competitors. Steps 2, 3, and 4: Use your competitors’ websites, as well as SEO analysis tools like Ahrefs, to deep-dive into the service offerings and marketing strategies of each company. Step 5: Focusing back on your own company, you conduct a SWOT analysis to assess your own strategic goals and get a visual of your strengths and weaknesses. Step 6: Finally, you create a graph of the market landscape and conclude that there are two companies beating your company in customer satisfaction and market presence. After compiling this information into a table like the one below, you consider a unique strategy. To beat out your competitors, you can use localization. Instead of marketing to dentists nationwide like your competitors are doing, you decide to focus your marketing strategy on one region, state, or city. Once you’ve become the known SEO company for dentists in that city, you’ll branch out. You won’t know what conclusions you can draw from your competitive analysis until you do the work and see the results. Whether you decide on a new pricing strategy, a way to level up your marketing, or a revamp of your product, understanding your competition can provide significant insight.Create a competitive analysis templateDrawbacks of competitive analysisThere are some drawbacks to competitive analysis you should consider before moving forward with your report. While these drawbacks are minor, understanding them can make you an even better manager or business owner. Don’t forget to take actionYou don’t just want to gather the information from your competitive analysis—you also want to take action on that information. The data itself will only show you where you fit into the market landscape. The key to competitive analysis is using it to problem solve and improve your company’s strategic plan.Be wary of confirmation biasConfirmation bias means interpreting information based on the beliefs you already hold. This is bad because it can cause you to hold on to false beliefs. To avoid bias, you should rely on all the data available to back up your decisions. In the example above, the business owner may believe they’re the best in the SEO dental market at social media. Because of this belief, when they do market research for social media, they may only collect enough information to confirm their own bias—even if their competitors are statistically better at social media. However, if they were to rely on all the data available, they could eliminate this bias.Update your analysis regularlyA competitive analysis report represents a snapshot of the market landscape as it currently stands. This report can help you gain enough information to make changes to your company, but you shouldn’t refer to the document again unless you update the information regularly. Market trends are always changing, and although it’s tedious to update your report, doing so will ensure you get accurate insight into your competitors at all times. Boost your marketing strategy with competitive analysisLearning your competitors’ strengths and weaknesses will make you a better marketer. If you don’t know the competition you’re up against, you can’t beat them.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA
""EBITDA"" is defined as net loss before interest expense, income tax expense or benefit, and depreciation and amortization. ""Adjusted EBITDA"" is defined as EBITDA adjusted for stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, asset impairments, and other costs associated with exit and disposal activities, acquisition and related costs, changes to the fair value of contingent earnout shares liability, and any other one-time non-recurring transaction amounts impacting the statement of operations during the year. Adjusted EBITDA is intended as a supplemental measure of our performance that is neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. We believe Adjusted EBITDA, when combined with net loss, and EBITDA, is beneficial to an investor's complete understanding of our operating performance. We believe that the use of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial measures with those of comparable companies, which may present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. However, you should be aware that when evaluating EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA we may incur future expenses similar to those excluded when calculating these measures. In addition, our presentation of these measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Our computation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures computed by other companies, because all companies may not calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in the same fashion.
Because of these limitations, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. We manage our business utilizing EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as supplemental performance measures.

The push for the use of electric vehicles in the U.S. is ramping up. Especially in California as the state just put a ban on gas-burning cars by 2035. Tony Aquila, the CEO of Canoo, a public EV company, is certain he can compete with brands like Tesla. But there’s one hurdle—Canoo hasn’t yet generated any revenue. 
Walmart signed an agreement with Canoo in July to purchase 4,500 all-electric delivery vehicles, beginning with the Lifestyle Delivery Vehicle, with the option to purchase up to 10,000 units. But the company is “hanging on by a thread,” writes my colleague Jessica Mathews.
“Inside the chaos at Canoo, the zero-revenue, cash-burning EV company that just inked a major deal with Walmart,” is Mathews’ new report that gives the scoop on the inner workings of the Bentonville, Arkansas-based startup.
Canoo said in its Q2 2022 earnings report the company has “over $1 billion” in its sales pipeline. But it reported a net loss of $164.4 million, up from $112.6 million in Q2 of last year. 
On the Aug. 8 earnings call, Ramesh Murthy, interim CFO and chief accounting officer, talked about the “road to profitability.” Murthy said: “It’s becoming more clear to everyone that our philosophy on cash and access to capital is in line with what a technology-driven company would do. We are milestone and event focused on how we access capital on our road to profitability. By focusing on milestones and key events, we can drive sustainable value to the company and all our stakeholders.”
Mathews interviewed Aquila in June and rode in one of Canoo’s futuristic electric campervans. 
“Canoo’s vehicles were still going through test programs and not yet on the market,” she writes. “Production wouldn’t begin until at least the end of 2022, and the company hadn’t started construction on its own manufacturing facilities. (The van we were sitting in was a prototype.)”
She continues, “Canoo had just recently signed an agreement with hedge fund Yorkville Advisors to sell up to $250 million worth of its shares at a discount to their already depressed market price. The Securities and Exchange Commission was investigating the company over its 2020 SPAC merger, and the company was tied up in three legal spats, including two class action lawsuits from retail investors in its shares. Indeed, right there in an SEC filing from March 31, Canoo itself had said it might not make it another year.” 
“And yet, Aquila—the tattooed, 57-year-old private-equity executive who had begun taking control of the company in 2020—looked me right in the eye when I asked about whether Canoo had the funding it needed for the next year. ‘I am a just-in-time capital guy,’ he assured me.” Mathews also discovered that Walmart’s purchase of yet-to-be-produced EVs is not the first financial boost that Aquila has received from the Walmart family in his career.  
Automakers are now required to steadily increase their sales of zero-emission cars in California, the nation’s largest auto market. And because 17 other states typically follow California’s auto-emissions standards, last week’s vote by the California Air Resources Board could reach far beyond the state, requiring the auto industry to speed up its switch to electric cars, Fortune reported. 
As the electric vehicle market continues to evolve, “Canoo is hardly the only EV startup to take investors and employees on a wild ride over the past couple of years,” Mathews writes. “Concern over climate change has lured an unprecedented amount of investor capital into the space, but the logistical challenges of launching an automaker from scratch haven’t gotten any less daunting.”
But, “Crack open the hood even an inch, however, and it’s clear that, even with the Walmart deal, Canoo is floundering to an extreme degree,” Mathews writes. (You can read the complete article here.)

Sheryl Estradasheryl.estrada@fortune.comBig dealDeloitte’s Q3 CFO Signals survey released today found that, overall, nearly half (46%) of CFOs expect the North American economy to be in recession by the new year. But it also varies by industry. For example, 67% of CFOs in the energy/resources industry expect a recession in North America by 2023, compared to 52% of CFOs in manufacturing, 50% in technology, 48% in financial services, and 25% in health care. CFOs are pursuing recession-proofing measures such as reducing operating expenses, controlling headcount, and reprioritizing capital expenditure. However, CFOs’ concerns over inflation vastly outweighed recession concerns. CFOs have lower expectations for year-over-year revenue growth— 6.2% this quarter, down from 7.8% in Q2 2022. Meanwhile, earnings growth expectations are at 6.4%, a decline from 8.4% in the prior quarter. The findings of Deloitte's quarterly CFO survey are based on a survey of 112 CFOs (74% from public companies and 26% from privately held firms). Respondents are from the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, and the vast majority are from companies with more than $1 billion in annual revenue.Going deeper""Gen X is cutting back on everything because of inflation—except retirement savings,"" a Fortune report by Alicia Adamczyk, is an analysis of State Street Global Advisors’s recent Inflation Impact Survey. As Gen X gets closer to retirement, they’re “significantly” more concerned about rising prices than millennials or Baby Boomers. LeaderboardDave McKinstray was named CFO at North America Cereal Co., the upcoming spinoff of Kellogg Company (NYSE: K). As announced in June 2022, Kellogg Company plans to separate three of its businesses—Global Snacking Co., North America Cereal Co., and Plant Co. McKinstray held several CFO roles throughout his nearly 15 years at Kellogg, such as CFO of the U.S. Snacks business and as CFO of U.S. Retail Sales before moving into his current role as VP of integrated business planning. His roles before Kellogg included positions in commodity risk management and trading.Christoph Pachler was named CFO at FaZe Holdings Inc. (Nasdaq: FAZE) a lifestyle and media platform focused on gaming and youth culture, effective on or before October 3. Pachler has more than 25 years of financial management experience. Pachler joins FaZe Clan from Critical Content, an independent television studio in Los Angeles, where he served as managing director and CFO. Before Critical Content, Pachler was the EVP and CFO for Playboy Enterprises, a media and brand licensing company. Pachler previously spent 13 years in various expanding roles at Sony Pictures Entertainment, where he was lastly the CFO and SVP for strategy and operations in Sony's international TV business.Overheard""Inflation numbers can miss the mark on properly reflecting a country’s economic mood because these figures offer an incomplete picture of a country’s economic health. Consumer sentiment, on the other hand, reflects our attitudes about the current state of the economy and expectations about its trajectory. And by all accounts, consumer sentiment is at record lows–and its decline has been more protracted than during past dips.""—Christos A.

Businesses use that data to identify their strengths and weaknesses and discover potential opportunities. A competitor analysis can help you understand the market landscape and make informed decisions to improve your position in the industry. Depending on your business, you can analyze competitors in many ways. But we’ll cover the basic steps you need to know.Pro tipGenerate a competitive analysis snapshot in a few clicks with Semrush’s Market Explorer. Get competitor data, like: Market Share by Channel Traffic Sources Organic TrafficWhy Competitive Analyses Are ImportantCompetitive analyses are essential for any business that wants to succeed in a crowded and competitive market.Regularly conducting competitive analyses can help you: Understand your market and industry Compare your results with your competitors’ performance Identify gaps in your strategy that your competitors address Develop strategies and tactics that promote your unique value proposition Stay on top of market changes to gain a competitive edge over your competitorsRead on to find out how you can get started.What to Include in a Competitive AnalysisThe factors you include in your competitor analysis depend largely on your goals and industry.For example, an online pet store owner will want to see what products their competitors sell that they don’t. A SaaS company, on the other hand, will probably want to look into their competitors’ features and pricing pages.To get you started, here are seven factors that stay the same across the board:Features or ProductsCompare your features or products to your competitors’ and highlight those that make you stand out or fall behind.For example, if you’re selling an email marketing tool, you might want to compare features such as: Templates Segmentation Automation Support IntegrationsThat way, you get a clearer picture of what your competitors are doing differently and why.PricingPricing is the amount of money you charge for your product or service.Use your competitors’ pricing strategy to guide your own. And make sure you’re not over- or under-charging your customers. Suppose you run an online course platform. You might want to compare pricing factors such as: Pricing model (e.g., subscription, one-time, freemium) Pricing tiers (e.g., basic, premium, enterprise) Pricing options (e.g., monthly, annual, lifetime) Pricing discounts (e.g., coupons, bundles, referrals) Pricing value (e.g., features, quality, reputation)Target AudienceTarget audience is the group of people you’d like to reach and serve with your product or service.When conducting a competitive analysis in marketing, try to discern who your competitors are targeting. How does it differ from your target audience? What are their needs, preferences, behaviors, and pain points? Are they targeting someone you aren’t? How can you better serve them?For example, if you run a fitness app, you might want to compare target audience characteristics such as: Demographics (e.g., age, gender, location) Psychographics (e.g., interests, values, goals) Behaviors (e.g., habits, preferences, pain points) Needs (e.g., problems, solutions, benefits)MarketingMarketing is the process of promoting and selling your product or service to your target audience. Look at your competitors’ marketing strategies to identify how you can improve your own. And increase your awareness, visibility, and conversions.For example, if you own a travel booking website, you might want to compare marketing channels such as: Website (e.g., design, content, SEO) Social media (e.g., platforms, posts, engagement) Email (e.g., newsletters, campaigns, open rates) Advertising (e.g., platforms, ads, clicks) PR (e.g., media coverage, press releases, reviews)DifferentiatorsDifferentiators are the factors that make your product or service unique and superior.Identify what that means for you.Look at how your customers position themselves to find out what sets you apart. And how your product or service is better.Then, communicate those differentiators to your customers. For example, if you sell a vegan meal delivery service, you might want to highlight differentiators such as: Quality (e.g., organic ingredients, fresh delivery) Variety (e.g., cuisines, dishes, flavors) Convenience (e.g., easy ordering, flexible plans) Sustainability (e.g., eco-friendly packaging, carbon offsetting) Social impact (e.g., donations, partnerships)StrengthsStrengths are the aspects of your product or service that give you an advantage over your competitors. List and analyze your strengths in your competition analysis. So that you know what you can double down on.For example, if you run a cloud storage service, you might identify strengths such as: Security (e.g., encryption, backup) Speed (e.g., upload, download) Storage (e.g., space, files) Collaboration (e.g., sharing, editing) Innovation (e.g., features, updates)WeaknessesWeaknesses are the aspects of your product or service that put you at a disadvantage compared to your competitors. List these out as well. Acknowledge them. Analyze how they affect your performance and results. And then work on improving them.For example, if you are selling a video streaming platform, you might want identify weaknesses such as: Content (e.g., quantity, quality, exclusivity) Pricing (e.g., cost, value, affordability) User experience (e.g., interface, navigation, personalization) Customer service (e.g., support, feedback, retention) Competition (e.g., rivals, threats, substitutes)How to Do a Competitive AnalysisBefore you start this walkthrough, grab a copy of Semrush’s Competitive Analysis Template to follow along.Here’s what it looks like:Perform a competitor analysis with these seven steps.TipCreate a free Semrush account (no credit card needed) to follow along with the steps in this guide.1. Identify Your CompetitorsFirst, build a list of key competitors to watch out for.This lets you see who might be competing for your audience’s attention. And gives you an idea of who to focus on throughout your competitor analysis.We’ll walk you through how to find your competitors in these four key areas: Your industry Organic search  Paid search Your communitySo that you can enter your data into your competitive analysis document. Like this:Find Your Industry CompetitorsYour industry competitors sell similar products or services to yours.Focus primarily on direct competitors, though. Meaning brands that fill a similar gap within your niche.An example of direct competitors is Abercrombie & Fitch and Aritzia. Both fashion brands focus on trendy women’s clothing—popular with Generation Z and younger millennials. They occupy the same position in the market.An indirect competitor would be Animal Crossing and Mortal Kombat. They’re both video games, but their audiences are vastly different.You should also consider your business’s size and competition level. For example, a local Toyota dealership may rank for similar keywords as the overarching Toyota brand.This doesn’t mean they will directly compete. The local dealership’s competition would be other local dealerships instead. Keep context in mind as you use competitor analysis tools.Here are a few ways to identify direct competitors: Market research: Study the market to find companies selling similar products that fulfill the same purpose. Talk to your sales team to find out which companies often come up in their sales process. Customer feedback: Once customers decide on your product, ask them what other products they were considering. This will help you identify closely related companies. Social media and online communities: Many people seek recommendations on social media or forums like Reddit and Quora. Investigate customer conversations on these sites to find potential competitors.For a general view of your digital competitors in your industry, use a competitor analysis tool like Market Explorer.First, select “Find Competitors” and enter your domain. This will automatically generate a list of the major players in your space.The “Overview” tab will show you who you compete with online. It will also visualize their relative market share, audience size, and growth rate.Now, scroll to the “Growth Quadrant” widget.The Growth Quadrant chart breaks down you and your competitors into four basic categories:  Niche Players: New or small companies with smaller audience size and a low growth rate Game Changers: Emerging companies with a comparatively smaller audience size that are growing quickly Established Players: Companies with large, established audiences Leaders: Companies with both a large audience and a rapid growth rateNote where each competitor stands. And how their audience and traffic growth compare to yours. Which players occupy the same quadrant as you? Which should you be most concerned about?Once you’ve identified key competitors in your industry, research their online presence through organic, paid, and local searches.Find Your Organic CompetitorsNext, identify your competitors in organic search. These are brands that target the same SEO keywords as you.These can differ from industry competitors. They may not have the same type of business you do. But they still compete with you in Google’s search results.You can easily find organic competitors with the “Competitors” report in Semrush’s Organic Research tool.Start by entering your domain and clicking “Search.”Then, click on the “Competitors” tab.You’ll see a list of organic competitors sorted by Competition Level. This metric is based on the number of keywords a competitor ranks for. And the number of keywords you and the competitor share. Like so:Note your biggest organic search competitors and any new names that did not appear in Market Explorer.Pro tipHead to the “Position Changes” tab to see the specific keywords your top organic competitors have been ranking for and monitor how their rankings shift over time to identify keyword opportunities. Find Your Paid Search CompetitorsNext, look for your paid search competitors. These are businesses that show up for the paid keywords you’re targeting.Ads that show up for users depend on many factors, including location, device, and context of the search term.A tool like Advertising Research can help you identify who your paid competitors are. And how their paid ads perform.To get started, enter your domain and hit “Search.”Next, head to the “Competitors” tab.Scroll and you’ll see a list of paid search competitors, sorted by competition level:You can also see how many paid keywords you have in common, how much paid traffic your competitors’ ads drive, and how many paid keywords your competitors rank for.Find Your Local SEO CompetitorsIf you run a business with a physical storefront, you must identify your local competitors—both online and offline.These are competitors who offer a similar product or service (filling the same market gap) within your geographic area. To do that, track important local keywords and compare your business’s proximity with other sites that rank for those keywords.And you’ll want to make sure your website ranks prominently on Google for location-specific keywords. That means optimizing your site for local SEO so you’ll appear in local search results. Like so:You can start your competitor research by using the Keyword Overview tool. To see what the SERP (search engine results page) looks like for keywords like “pizza near me.”The top-ranking domains are your local SEO competitors.To then track important local keywords and competitors, use the Position Tracking tool.Enter your domain in the Position Tracking tool. And, click “Set up tracking.”Set a local target (e.g., the city or state where your company operates).On the next page, you can add the keywords you’d like to track and click “Add keywords to campaign.”Now, you’re ready to “Start Tracking.”Once your campaign is ready, visit the “Competitors Discovery” tab to find local competitors.You’ll get a list of competitors sorted by “Visibility.”Visibility is based on click-through rate (CTR) and shows a website’s progress in Google’s top 100 ranked webpages for keywords in the current tracking campaign.Take note of competitors who are dominating the local conversation. Then, ensure your website is optimized for local search with up-to-date address and contact information across all your platforms (especially your Google Business Profile). Further reading: Local Keyword Research for SEO: What It Is & How to Do It Google My Business: A Guide to Google Business Profile2. Create Competitor ProfilesBuilding a profile for each of your main competitors allows you to benchmark important details, including market share and audience demographics.Here’s what that’ll look like in your competitive analysis document:Let’s begin by analyzing market share, or the influence a brand has within their industry.Analyzing Market ShareMarket share is a percentage of a company’s sales or revenue out of the total sales or revenue for its industry.Publicly traded companies are required to state their earnings every quarter.Many private companies are, too. So, you can get a lot of information by searching “[company name] quarterly report” or “[company name] annual report” in Google.You can also consider estimations from trusted business publications.For example, Yahoo Finance reports on a lot of this information for public companies.Here’s some of the market share information for Apple:To calculate market share, divide the total company revenue by total industry sales.Like this: Select a fiscal period (usually quarterly or annual) Calculate a company’s total sales for that period Calculate the industry’s total sales for that period Divide the company’s revenue by industry sales Multiply that number by 100 to find the market share percentageHere’s a real-world example: Toyota sold 2,332,262 vehicles in the U.S. in 2021.And 15 million total vehicles were sold in the U.S. during the same period.If we divide Toyota’s total sales (2,332,262) by the industry’s total sales (15,000,000), we get 0.155.Multiply that by 100, and we get 15.5%. Which is Toyota’s market share for 2021.We recommend completing this step for your main direct competitors. It’ll help you benchmark your success within your industry.Understanding Audience DemographicsMarket share shows you which competitor has the biggest influence over your audience. But it doesn’t tell you who that audience is. Understanding audience demographics can help you connect with customers and create products and services that address their needs.You can use a tool like Market Explorer to analyze any website’s audience demographics. Enter a competitor’s URL and head to the “Audience” tab.This report provides a high-level overview of the audience demographics in your niche, including: Age and sex Social media preferences Audience interestsNext, find out how your audience compares to and overlaps with your closest competitors. You can do this with Traffic Analytics.Select “Check Competitors.” Then, enter your domain and up to four competitor domains into the search bar, and click “Analyze.” Now, head to the “Audience Overview” tab. You’ll see a side-by-side comparison of each domain’s audience. And how much they overlap. Building Your Competitor Profiles It’s time to round out your competitor profiles by filling in basic company information. This provides context that could help you analyze your findings. And build a more competitive marketing strategy.For example, one of your competitors may have only been around for a few years. But if they’ve raised millions in funding rounds, they may be a bigger threat to you than a larger, more established competitor.You can find basic information about your competitors in the “Company Info” section of the Traffic Analytics “Overview” report. Just scroll down and you’ll see the widget. You can see which categories your competitors operate in, their funding amount, and roughly how many employees they have.Further reading: How to Use Website Demographics to Improve Your Marketing Strategy3. Analyze Your Competitors' Product, Pricing, Place, and Promotional StrategiesOnce you have all the preliminary insights, it’s time to explore “the four Ps” of marketing: product, price, place, and promotion. Let’s break it down: Product: How the product meets customers’ needs Pricing: How much their product or service costs Place: Where customers are looking for the product Promotion: How they advertise to their customersAdd that information to your competitive analysis document so that you can access and analyze the data easier:Analyzing this information about your competitors will give you a deeper understanding of their marketing strategies.You can replicate what’s already working in a better way. And avoid making the same mistakes. ProductBegin by visiting each competitor’s site and asking yourself: What’s their most popular product or service? What features does the product offer? Who’s the target audience for this product? What problem does this product solve?Take notes on your findings.Your competitors’ websites will give you insights into which products they prioritize. And which products they heavily promote or prominently display in their navigational menus.Steve Madden, for example, heavily prioritizes women’s apparel and accessories. They have several main navigation drop-downs for these topics: ”Women’s Shoes,” “Women’s Clothing,” “Handbags,” and “Accessories.”Like this:If we scroll further, we can also see that they are promoting what is probably a popular product right on the homepage:This is why manual investigation is important—you can get clear insights into what your competitor prioritizes just by navigating their site.PriceOnce you’ve identified popular products, pay attention to pricing.Here are some things to note in your competitor analysis: How does your competitor’s product pricing line up against comparable products? Do they have frequent sales, discounts, or other special offers?Of course, you need to make a profit. But if you notice that your competitors price similar products lower or constantly offer discounts, you may need to change your pricing strategy.PlaceThe third P refers to where your product or service is available. This can be a physical storefront, an online store, or both.If you place your product somewhere—in person or online—where your target audience doesn’t shop, you probably won’t see great results.To start, here are a couple of questions to consider: Where does your target audience shop? What distribution channels should you use to reach your audience?Here’s an example of “place” in action:Celebrity makeup artist Patrick Ta is known for his famous clients and luxury makeup line. So, it makes more sense that he sells his products in Sephora stores rather than affordable retail chains like Walmart or CVS.Place also applies to where you market your product.Say your company offers financial planning services. Your core audience probably skews a little older. So, it wouldn’t make much sense to market your services on Snapchat, which has a notoriously young audience without as much buying power.PromotionPromotion is all about where your competitors market their products or services. This includes both advertising channels and brand messaging.Here are a couple of things to consider when researching your competitors’ promotion strategies: Which of your competitor’s promotional channels drive the most traffic? (This could include direct, referral, paid, organic, or social.) What is their advertising strategy?To get an idea of how your competitors generate their traffic, head to the “Benchmarking” report in Market Explorer. You’ll see a breakdown of their traffic generation and social media distribution. And can compare up to five competitors at once. Like this:Here are a few conclusions you may draw from competitors’ best-performing channels: Direct: Direct traffic is when users navigate to a website directly, without the push of ads or links. So your competitor likely has strong brand awareness Referral: Referral traffic is when users arrive on a website through another source, like a link on another domain. So your competitor probably has a strong backlink profile, places banner ads on other sites, or has a strong digital PR presence Search: Search is traffic from organic search, which means your competitor prioritizes SEO and content. You can analyze their content marketing and identify their top pages. Social: Your competitor likely has a solid social media presence with an engaged audience. Investigate which platforms they use most. Paid: Your competitor probably has a strong advertising budget, particularly for paid search. Investigate which keywords they’re bidding on and analyze their ad copy with our Advertising Research tool.4. Evaluate Competitor Marketing StrategiesOne of the best ways to understand a competitor’s marketing efforts is to browse their website. It’s manual work, but it’s well worth the effort.Pay attention to any of the following elements: Do they run a blog? Do they produce whitepapers or ebooks? Do they share videos or webinars? Do they host a podcast? Do they use static visual content like infographics and cartoons? How about case studies? Do they have an FAQs section? Do they showcase featured articles? Do you notice press releases? Do they have a media kit? Do they publish buying guides and data sheets? How much are they investing in PPC? What online and offline advertising campaigns are they using?Take note of what your competitors are doing and what you aren’t.See what’s missing from your site and incorporate relevant missing elements into your own strategy. You should also look into your competitors’ paid marketing strategies.And you can easily do that with a tool like Advertising Research. Enter a competitor’s domain and click “Analyze.” You’ll see a dashboard with a summary of their ad campaigns, including: The number of keywords bringing in traffic from paid search The estimated monthly traffic from paid search The estimated average monthly cost to rank for those keywords in Google AdsScroll down and you’ll get a list of keywords your competitor is bidding for in Google Ads. Plus, you’ll see: The position they’re ranking for The average CPC for each keyword The exact URL they’re targeting with each keywordLike so:If you want to dive a little deeper, click on the “Ads Copies” tab. You’ll see the actual ad copy your competitor is running in Google Ads. And the keywords that trigger those ads. Further reading: What Is Google Ads & How Does It Work? A Comprehensive Guide Marketing Strategy Guide: What It Is and How to Create One5. Analyze Marketing ChannelsOne of the most important aspects of competitive analysis is to understand how your competitors are reaching their target audience. In other words, what marketing channels are they using? How effective are they? How can you leverage them for your own business?And these marketing channels can be divided into eight main categories: Direct: When a user enter the URL directly into a browser's search bar Referral: When a user visits from clicking a link on another website Organic search: When a user visits from a search engine’s organic results Paid search: When a user visits from a search engine’s paid search ads Organic social: When a user visits from clicking a link on social media Paid social: When a user visits from clicking an ad on social media Email: When a user visits from clicking a link or banner in an email Display ads: When a user visits from clicking a display ad (banner, image, video, etc.) on another websiteYou can quickly analyze any competitor’s marketing channels with Market Explorer. Just enter their URL and scroll down to the “Domain vs Market Dynamics” widget. Click on each marketing channel to examine it more closely.Like this:Try to see how your main competitors’ marketing channels compare to yours. And record that data in your competitive analysis document.And determine whether you need to make any changes to say or get ahead.Further reading: Effective Digital Marketing Channels & How to Use Them6. Identify Your Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities & ThreatsAfter completing your competitor analysis, turn your observations into actionable insights by performing a SWOT analysis.SWOT stands for strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. A SWOT analysis looks like this—you’ll fill in each quadrant for your brand based on your competitive analysis findings:If you fill out a SWOT analysis for both your brand and your competitors, you can compare the answers to the above questions to see where each brand excels.This will help you identify where you’re doing well and where you can improve.Further reading: SWOT Analysis: What It Is & How to Do It [Examples + Template] How to Do a Competitive Landscape Analysis7. Track & Monitor ResultsOnce you have done your competitive analysis, you need to track and monitor results. This’ll help you measure your effectiveness and identify areas for improvement.There are different ways to do this, depending on your goals and metrics. But one of the most efficient is to set up a monthly competitor report. Head to My Reports, scroll through, and select “Monthly Competitor Analysis.”Enter your domain and two competitor domains. And click “Create report.”You’ll quickly get a competitor analysis report.First is a summary of your domain’s current performance. Then, you’ll see how your domain compares to your competitors. Like so: The great thing about the report is that it’s interactive. You can edit, add, or remove any widget you want. For example, if you want to add more competitors to “Traffic Analytics Overview,” hover over the widget and click the pencil icon.Add more competitors to the “Competitors” box, and click “Apply.” Here:The widget will immediately display data for the competitors you added. Once you’re done, click “Generate PDF report” on the top right. In the pop-up, enable “Email report” and “Schedule report.” Select your ideal time frame for the tool to run the report and email it to you.And click “Generate and send.” Now you have an easy and effective way to track and monitor performance against competitors. How Often Should You Do a Competitor Analysis?You should run a competitor analysis at least every quarter. And ideally every month. Why? Because digital marketing is always changing. And you need to stay on top of what your competitors are doing. However, you may also want to do a competitor analysis even more frequently. Especially if you notice any significant events or trends that affect your industry. For example, you may want to do an ad-hoc competitor analysis if you’re: Launching a new product or service Entering a new market or segment Facing a new competitor or losing market share Changing your pricing or positioning Updating your branding or messagingWhatever frequency you choose, make sure to set a clear schedule and stick to it. Doing a competitor analysis can help you stay ahead of the curve and gain a competitive edge in your market.Keep Tabs on the CompetitionYou’ve learned how to conduct a competitive analysis and why it’s important for your business.But don’t stop there. The market is constantly changing, and so are your competitors. You need to keep an eye on their strategies, strengths, weaknesses, and opportunities.You can do that with Market Explorer.

The constantly evolving marketing landscape requires successful marketers to keep abreast of emerging trends. Understanding and adapting to these trends -- driven by the often-clashing forces of technological advancements, consumer behaviors, market dynamics and global events -- is essential for marketers to maintain a competitive edge in today's fast-paced, digital-centric world.








By paying close attention to and learning from these trends, astute marketers gain valuable insights into their consumers' evolving needs, preferences and behavior patterns. Better still, they provide their companies with more effective, targeted and personalized marketing strategies.
To unlock new avenues of growth, marketers must experiment with new tools and technologies, leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) for personalized marketing, as well as employing virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) for immersive customer experiences.
Here's a look at key market trends in 2024, their central role in driving innovation and growth, and how these trends, if properly understood and harnessed, make brands more resilient within their unique marketplaces and against an ever-growing competitive landscape.

1. Artificial intelligence and machine learning
AI and ML are poised to significantly influence marketing trends this year and beyond because they streamline and personalize consumer experiences. In 2023, the Sprout Social Index found that 81% of marketers say AI has had a positive impact on their work and that it also helps in creative areas such as content planning and productivity. AI and ML automate some repetitive tasks, freeing marketers to focus on strategy and creative initiatives. Moreover, these technologies analyze vast amounts of data to glean insights for a more targeted, efficient marketing strategy adaptable to changing consumer behavior patterns.
AI and ML also excel at personalizing the customer journey by tailoring ads and product recommendations, as well as predicting future consumer behavior. In this instance, AI algorithms process a customer's past behavior, social media interactions and other data to forecast their future actions, allowing companies to cater proactively to their preferences.
Finally, AI and ML contribute to more effective customer segmentation. Instead of relying on broad demographic information, these technologies partition customers based on nuanced behavioral patterns and preferences. This allows brands to create highly tailored marketing campaigns that resonate with specific customer groups.


2. Voice search optimization
As the adoption of smart speakers and voice-activated devices continues to rise, the shift to voice search optimization is expected to continue, underpinned by consumer preference for hands-free, voice-activated technology. Additionally, with advancements in natural language processing and AI, voice search technology delivers more accurate and personalized responses, which contribute to a positive user experience.
The increased prevalence of voice search also brings about a significant change to the search engine optimization (SEO) landscape. Traditional keyword strategies require reevaluation as voice searches typically involve more conversational and long-tail phrases. Moreover, the ""position zero"" or featured snippet on search engine results pages becomes even more desirable since voice assistants often pull their responses from these highlights. Hence, marketers need to adapt their SEO strategies to ensure their content is voice search-friendly and capable of earning that coveted spot.
Furthermore, voice commerce represents a promising frontier for businesses. As consumers become more comfortable using voice commands to complete a range of tasks, the leap to voice-activated purchasing is natural. Brands that optimize their content for voice search are better positioned to tap into this emerging market, driving sales and enhancing customer convenience.


3. Increased use of chatbots
The increase in the use of chatbots, including both AI-powered and rules-based versions, is a compelling trend for several reasons. First, chatbots offer companies a cost-efficient, round-the-clock customer service solution. They can handle multiple customer queries simultaneously, providing immediate responses and improving customer satisfaction levels. AI-powered chatbots learn from every interaction, enabling them to deliver increasingly personalized responses over time and enhance user engagement.Second, chatbots are highly versatile marketing tools, used not only for customer service but also for product recommendations, appointment scheduling and lead qualification. This versatility becomes increasingly valuable as businesses seek to maximize their online engagement. Additionally, rules-based chatbots provide a consistent, reliable service that's adaptable to a brand's specific requirements, making them a preferable option for companies that deal with straightforward customer queries.
Third, along with increasing customer engagement and potential revenue for businesses, chatbots save company resources -- both time and dollars.


4. Personalized marketing
Brands that engage in personalized marketing create a bond with their audience, enhancing customer satisfaction and loyalty. Unlike generic marketing, personalized marketing speaks directly to the customer, addressing that individual's unique needs and preferences. This shift to building trusting relationships and providing a better customer experience promises increased conversions, customer retention and, ultimately, revenue growth.
Additionally, with advancements in AI and ML technologies, the possibilities for personalization are expanding. Brands can analyze customer behaviors and preferences in real time, allowing them to finetune marketing efforts to each customer. This leads to more effective and efficient marketing strategies, as resources are concentrated on the most impactful channels and methods, ultimately improving return on investment (ROI).


5. Video marketing
The ubiquity of internet connectivity and the ever-increasing power of modern smartphones have made video content more accessible than ever before. Consumers can now stream high-quality video on the go, making it a powerful tool to catch their attention and deliver impactful messages. Moreover, platforms such as TikTok, as well as features like Instagram Reels and YouTube Shorts have popularized short-form video content, driving brands to adopt this format to reach and engage their audience.
In addition, video content offers a unique blend of audiovisual elements that allows marketers to tell more engaging and persuasive stories, helping their products and services stand out in a saturated market. Video content can seamlessly incorporate customer testimonials, product demonstrations, behind-the-scenes insights and many other elements that build trust and cultivate a deeper connection with the audience or even encourage purchases.
Lastly, video marketing impacts key metrics such as SEO, conversion and click-through rates. Research shows that incorporating videos into marketing emails can boost click-through rates, while embedding videos on landing pages can increase conversion rates. Indeed, successful video marketing in 2024 aligns with the data-driven approach that modern marketing strategies strive to adopt.


6. Social commerce
By enabling direct purchases within the same social media apps where consumers connect, share and inspire each other, social commerce platforms are transforming the shopping journey into a seamless, convenient experience. With features ranging from shoppable posts to in-app stores, brands have the opportunity to target and convert consumers within a familiar social context, effectively shortening the path to purchase.
Moreover, social commerce leverages the power of user-generated content and peer-to-peer influence, key elements in today's consumer decision-making process. Consumers can see how products look in real life, read reviews and even make inquiries to brands through direct messages, all in one platform. This immersive, interactive shopping experience, coupled with the ability to instantly share and discuss products with friends and followers, amplifies word-of-mouth marketing and encourages impulsive buying behaviors. As such, social commerce is expected to keep its momentum in the marketing landscape and can be used in conjunction with a marketing team's growing omnichannel customer experiences.


7. Influencer marketing
This marketing trend establishes an authentic connection with audiences that traditional advertising struggles to achieve. Influencers have a strong rapport with their followers, which makes their promotional content more engaging, relatable, impactful and trustworthy.
The intersection of influencer marketing, video content, and social commerce creates a potent combination for brands. As consumers continue to shop directly from social media platforms, influencers tap into this trend by creating engaging video content showcasing products, encouraging their followers to click through and make a purchase. This seamless integration of shopping and social media amplifies the efficacy of influencer marketing and underlines its importance in a company's marketing strategies.





8. Sustainable and ethical marketing
The continued adoption of sustainable and ethical marketing reflects a growing consumer consciousness around environmental impact and social issues. As people become increasingly informed and concerned about the biosphere, the ethical and sustainability practices of a business come into sharp focus for discerning would-be consumers. It's an opportunity for businesses to differentiate themselves, align with consumer values and forge stronger connections with their customer base.
In addition, companies adopting sustainable and ethical marketing practices gain a competitive advantage. Research shows that consumers are willing to pay a premium for products and services from companies committed to positive social and environmental impact. As such, sustainable and ethical marketing is not just a trend, but a strategic approach likely to drive consumer behavior and loyalty.


9. Virtual reality and augmented reality
VR and AR technology will be adopted by more businesses in 2024, transforming how companies interact with their customers, especially as it becomes more accessible to small- and medium-sized businesses. These immersive technologies offer an entirely new level of engagement, allowing consumers to experience products or services in a simulated environment before purchase. This not only enhances the customer's understanding of the product, but it also creates a memorable, engaging experience that increases brand loyalty.
In addition, AR and VR provide marketers with innovative ways to tell their brand stories. For instance, AR can overlay digital information on physical products or locations, providing an interactive experience. Meanwhile, VR can transport users to entirely new environments -- a virtual showroom or exotic location tied to a brand's narrative -- and even show how furniture or other large fixtures would fit in a specific room. These technologies change the dynamics of customer engagement and experience.


10. Big data and analytics
Marketers realize that comprehensive, accurate data can provide invaluable insights into customer behavior, preferences and trends. The ability to capture and analyze such vast volumes of data enables businesses to anticipate market changes, predict customer behavior and adjust their marketing strategies accordingly, leading to improved efficiency and higher ROI.
The convergence of machine learning and big data is opening up new vistas in predictive analytics, allowing for more precise customer segmentation and targeting. With sophisticated analytics tools, marketers can derive actionable insights and make more informed decisions, from identifying the most effective marketing channels to optimizing campaign performance. Thus, leveraging big data and analytics is not a new trend, it's a fundamental shift in the marketing landscape.
